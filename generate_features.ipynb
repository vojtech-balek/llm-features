    "    \"Quantitative research\": \"Involves the systematic collection and analysis of numerical data to describe and understand phenomena, test hypotheses, and establish patterns and relationships. Relies on statistical methods for data analysis.\",\n",
    "    \"Experiment\": \"A research method where researchers manipulate one or more variables under controlled conditions to observe the effect on another variable. Used to establish causality and relationships between variables.\",\n",
    "    \"Exploratory research\": \"Conducted to gain insights, identify research questions, and understand a problem more comprehensively. Often used in the early stages of research to explore new areas or phenomena.\",\n",
    "    \"Qualitative research\": \"Focuses on understanding human behavior, experiences, and perceptions through methods like interviews, observations, and textual analysis. Aims to uncover meanings and patterns.\",\n",
    "    \"Mixed methods\": \"Integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches in a single study to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a research problem. Combines strengths of both methods.\",\n",
    "    \"Observation\": \"Involves systematically watching and recording behaviors, events, or phenomena to gather data. Can be conducted in natural settings or controlled environments.\",\n",
    "    \"Applied research\": \"Aims to address specific practical problems and produce outcomes directly applicable to real-world situations. Often involves collaboration with stakeholders.\",\n",
    "    \"Descriptive research\": \"Seeks to describe characteristics or features of a population, phenomenon, or process without manipulating variables. Provides baseline information.\",\n",
    "    \"Focus groups\": \"Involve facilitated discussions with a small group of participants to gather insights, opinions, or attitudes on a specific topic. Provide qualitative data through group interactions.\",\n",
    "    \"Survey methodology\": \"Encompasses the design, implementation, and analysis of surveys to gather data from a sample of a population. Focuses on ensuring validity and reliability of survey instruments.\",\n",
    "    \"Correlational research\": \"Examines the relationship between variables to determine whether and how they co-vary. Assesses the strength and direction of associations but does not establish causation.\",\n",
    "    \"Interviews\": \"A method of data collection involving direct conversations with participants to gather detailed and in-depth information. Can be structured or unstructured.\",\n",
    "    \"Questionnaires\": \"Structured instruments consisting of a set of questions designed to gather standardized data from respondents. Used in survey research to collect quantitative data.\",\n",
    "    \"Secondary research\": \"Involves the use of existing data sources such as literature reviews, databases, or reports to address research questions. Provides a synthesis of existing knowledge.\",\n",
    "    \"Conclusive research\": \"Aims to provide final answers or conclusive findings to specific research questions or hypotheses. Often used to validate or refute existing theories or claims.\",\n",
    "    \"Ethnographic research\": \"Involves deep immersion in a social setting to understand the culture, behaviors, and practices of a group. Uses participant observation and qualitative methods.\"\n",
