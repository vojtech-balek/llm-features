The making of a socialist underworld: people on the margins in post-war Czechoslovakia (1945-60),"This text depicts the mechanisms that created the underworld and the profiles of people who formed a part of it in post-Second World War Czechoslovakia. The chronological framework is set between the end of the Second World War and the declaration of the so-called Socialist Constitution. It therefore covers the establishment of the Communist monopoly on power in February 1948, the period of Stalinism, the post-Stalinist thaw after 1953, and the amendment of Communist policies in the second half of the 1950s. It also shows the continuities between the principles set at the end of the war and the politics of the post-1948 period, as well as points to several continuities which go back deep into the nineteenth century. The existence of the underworld contrasts with the determination of the post-war political authorities to create a better and more moral society, which took radical forms after the establishment of the Communist monopoly on power. More precisely speaking, the underworld often grew out of this determination on the part of the authorities as well as from some specificities of the post-war welfare and economic politics. The text illustrates these mechanisms using the example of a number of personal destinies. For this, it uses a variety of sources: criminal reports, interrogation protocols and intelligence of the Public Security Service (Verejna bezpecnost) and various departments of the National Security Corps (Sbor narodni bezpecnosti, SNB), reports of the National Committees (Narodni vATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTEbory) and of the Ministry of the Interior and legal norms.

Selective Translation Complex Profiling Reveals Staged Initiation and Co-translational Assembly of Initiation Factor Complexes,"Translational control targeting the initiation phase is central to the regulation of gene expression. Understanding all of its aspects requires substantial technological advancements. Here we modified yeast translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq), related to ribosome profiling, and adapted it for mammalian cells. Human TCP-seq, capable of capturing footprints of 40S subunits (40Ss) in addition to 80S ribosomes (80Ss), revealed that mammalian and yeast 40Ss distribute similarly across 5'TRs, indicating considerable evolutionary conservation. We further developed yeast and human selective TCP-seq (Sel-TCP-seq), enabling selection of 40Ss and 80Ss associated with immuno-targeted factors. Sel-TCP-seq demonstrated that eIF2 and eIF3 travel along 5' UTRs with scanning 40Ss to successively dissociate upon AUG recognition, notably, a proportion of eIF3 lingers on during the initial elongation cycles. Highlighting Sel-TCP-seq versatility, we also identified four initiating 48S conformational intermediates, provided novel insights into ATF4 and GCN4 mRNA translational control, and demonstrated co-translational assembly of initiation factor complexes.",10608.0,"Wagner, Susan:Herrmannová, Anna:Hronová, Vladislava:Gunišová, Stanislava:Sen, N.

"Layered Black Phosphorus: Strongly Anisotropic Magnetic, Electronic, and Electron-Transfer Properties","Layered elemental materials, such as black phosphorus, exhibit unique properties originating from their highly anisotropic layered structure. The results presented herein demonstrate an anomalous anisotropy for the electrical, magnetic, and electrochemical properties of black phosphorus. It is shown that heterogeneous electron transfer from black phosphorus to outer- and inner-sphere molecular probes is highly anisotropic. The electron-transfer rates differ at the basal and edge planes. These unusual properties were interpreted by means of calculations, manifesting the metallic character of the edge planes as compared to the semiconducting properties of the basal plane. This indicates that black phosphorus belongs to a group of materials known as topological insulators. Consequently, these effects render the magnetic properties highly anisotropic, as both diamagnetic and paramagnetic behavior can be observed depending on the orientation in the magnetic field.",0.0,"Sofer, Zdeněk:Sedmidubský, David:Huber, Štěpán:Luxa, Jan:Bouša, Daniel:Boothroyd, Chris:Pumera, Martin",Angewandte Chemie-International Edition,1,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Geochemical Modelling of Igneous Processes - Principles and Recipes in R Language : Bringing the Power of R to a Geochemical Community,"The aim of this book is to unlock the power of the freeware R language to advanced university students and researchers dealing with whole-rock geochemistry of (meta-) igneous rocks. The first part covers data input/output, calculation of commonly used indexes and plotting in R. The core of the book then focusses on the presentation and practical implementations of modelling techniques used for fingerprinting processes such as partial melting, fractional crystallization, binary mixing or AFC using major-, trace-element and radiogenic isotope data. The reader will be given a firm theoretical basis for forward/reverse modelling, followed by exercises dealing with typical problems likely to be encountered in real life, and their solutions using R.

Plant diversity increases with the strength of negative density dependence at the global scale,"Theory predicts that higher biodiversity in the tropics is maintained by specialized interactions among plants and their natural enemies that result in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). By using more than 3000 species and nearly 2.4 million trees across 24 forest plots worldwide, we show that global patterns in tree species diversity reflect not only stronger CNDD at tropical versus temperate latitudes but also a latitudinal shift in the relationship between CNDD and species abundance. CNDD was stronger for rare species at tropical versus temperate latitudes, potentially causing the persistence of greater numbers of rare species in the tropics.

Lactobacillus plantarum strain maintains growth of infant mice during chronic undernutrition,"In most animal species, juvenile growth is marked by an exponential gain in body weight and size. Here we show that the microbiota of infant mice sustains both weight gain and longitudinal growth when mice are fed a standard laboratory mouse diet or a nutritionally depleted diet. We found that the intestinal microbiota interacts with the somatotropic hormone axis to drive systemic growth.

"The Influence of Aging, Hearing, and Tinnitus on the Morphology of Cortical Gray Matter, Amygdala, and Hippocampus","Age related hearing loss (presbycusis) is a natural process represented by elevated auditory thresholds and decreased speech intelligibility, especially in noisy conditions. Tinnitus is a phantom sound that also potentially leads to cortical changes, with its highest occurrence coinciding with the clinical onset of presbycusis. The aim of our project was to identify age, hearing loss and tinnitus related structural changes, within the auditory system and associated structures. Groups of subjects with presbycusis and tinnitus (22 subjects), with only presbycusis (24 subjects), young tinnitus patients with normal hearing (10 subjects) and young controls (17 subjects), underwent an audiological examination to characterize hearing loss and tinnitus. In addition, MRI (3T MR system, analysis in Freesurfer software) scans were used to identify changes in the cortical and subcortical structures. The following areas of the brain were analyzed: Heschl gyrus (HG), planum temporale (PT), primary visual cortex (V1), gyrus parahippocampus (PH), anterior insula (Ins), amygdala (Amg), and hippocampus (HP). A statistical analysis was performed in R framework using linear mixed-effects models with explanatory variables: age, tinnitus, laterality and hearing. In all of the cortical structures, the gray matter thickness decreased significantly with aging without having an effect on laterality (differences between the left and right hemispheres). The decrease in the gray matter thickness was faster in the HG, PT and Ins in comparison with the PH and V1. Aging did not influence the surface of the cortical areas, however there were differences between the surface size of the reported regions in the left and right hemispheres. Hearing loss caused only a borderline decrease of the cortical surface in the HG. Tinnitus was accompanied by a borderline decrease of the Ins surface and led to an increase in the volume of Amy and HP. In summary, aging is accompanied by a decrease in the cortical gray matter thickness, hearing loss only has a limited effect on the structure of the investigated cortical areas and tinnitus causes structural changes which are predominantly within the limbic system and insula, with the structure of the auditory system only being minimally affected.",30230.0,"Profant, Oliver:Škoch, A.:Tintěra, J.:Svobodová, Veronika:Kucharová, Diana:Svobodová Buriánová, Jana:Syka, Josef",Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Genetic insights into biological mechanisms governing human ovarian ageing,"Reproductive longevity is essential for fertility and influences healthy ageing in women(1,2), but insights into its underlying biological mechanisms and treatments to preserve it are limited. Here we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause in approximately 200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles were associated with clinical extremes of age at natural menopause, women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations(3). The identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR-associated genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increases fertility and extends reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicate that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing, when they act, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease.",10605.0,"Ruth, K.

Runes from Lany (Czech Republic) - The oldest inscription among Slavs. A new standard for multidisciplinary analysis of runic bones,"When Roman administration and legions gradually withdrew from the outer provinces after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, they created a power void filled by various groups. The dynamic Migration Period that followed is usually considered to have ended when the Germanic Lombards allegedly left Central Europe and were replaced by Slavs. Whether or how Slavic and Germanic tribes interacted, however, is currently disputed. Here we report the first direct archaeological find in support of a contact: a bone fragment dated to similar to 600 AD incised with Germanic runes but found in Lany, Czechia, a contemporaneous settlement associated with Slavs. We documented and authenticated this artifact using a combined approach of use-wear analysis with SEM microscopy, direct radiocarbon dating, and ancient DNA analysis of the animal bone, thereby setting a new standard for the investigation of runic bones.

Confirmed cannibalism in wild boar and its possible role in African swine fever transmision,"For the monitoring of wild boar interactions with conspecific carcasses, seven wild boar carcasses were placed in different sites in the Czech Republic during winter season. Data were collected by camera traps. In total, 732 visits were recorded of wild boars at the carcass sites. Direct contact with the carcass was detected in 81% of the records. Cannibalism was observed in 9.8% of all recorded visits. The first direct contact was observed on average 30 days after the carcass had been placed in its respective site. Cannibalism was observed on average after 70 days. The effect of sex-age class on direct contact was not proven in our study.

Evaluation of the Stability of DNA i-Motifs in the Nuclei of Living Mammalian Cells,"C-rich DNA has the capacity to form a tetra-stranded structure known as an i-motif. The i-motifs within genomic DNA have been proposed to contribute to the regulation of DNA transcription. However, direct experimental evidence for the existence of these structures invivo has been missing. Whether i-motif structures form in complex environment of living cells is not currently known. Herein, using state-of-the-art in-cell NMR spectroscopy, we evaluate the stabilities of i-motif structures in the complex cellular environment. We show that i-motifs formed from naturally occurring C-rich sequences in the human genome are stable and persist in the nuclei of living human cells. Our data show that i-motif stabilities invivo are generally distinct from those invitro. Our results are the first to interlink the stability of DNA i-motifs invitro with their stability invivo and provide essential information for the design and development of i-motif-based DNA biosensors for intracellular applications.",10608.0,"Džatko, Šimon:Krafčíková, Michaela:Hansel-Hertsch, R.:Fessl, T.:Fiala, Radovan:Loja, Tomáš:Krafčík, Daniel:Mergny, J.L.:Trantírková, Silvie:Trantírek, Lukáš",Angewandte Chemie International Edition,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Spectroscopic and Computational Evidence of Intramolecular AuI⋅⋅⋅H+−N Hydrogen Bonding,"Despite substantial evidence of short Au⋅⋅⋅H−X contacts derived from a number of X‐ray structures of AuI compounds, the nature of AuI⋅⋅⋅H bonding in these systems has not been clearly understood. Herein, we present the first spectroscopic evidence for an intramolecular AuI⋅⋅⋅H+−N hydrogen bond in a [Cl−Au−L]+ complex, where L is a protonated N‐heterocyclic carbene. The complex was isolated in the gas phase and characterized with helium‐tagging infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectra, in which H+−N‐mode‐derived bands evidence the intramolecular AuI⋅⋅⋅H+−N bond. Quantum chemical calculations reproduce the experimental IRPD spectra and allow to characterize the intramolecular Au⋅⋅⋅H+−N bonding with a short rAu⋅⋅⋅H distance of 2.17 Å and an interaction energy of approximately −10 kcal mol−1. Various theoretical descriptors of chemical bonding calculated for the Au⋅⋅⋅H+−N interaction provide strong evidence for a hydrogen bond of moderate strength.",10403.0,"Straka, Michal:Andris, E.:Vícha, J.:Růžička, A.:Roithová, J.:Rulíšek, Lubomír",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,1,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Toll-like receptor signaling in thymic epithelium controls monocyte-derived dendritic cell recruitment and Treg generation,"The development of thymic regulatory T cells (Treg) is mediated by Aire-regulated self-antigen presentation on medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and dendritic cells (DCs), but the cooperation between these cells is still poorly understood. Here we show that signaling through Toll-like receptors (TLR) expressed on mTECs regulates the production of specific chemokines and other genes associated with post-Aire mTEC development. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify a new thymic CD14(+)Sirp alpha (+) population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (CD14(+)moDC) that are enriched in the thymic medulla and effectively acquire mTEC-derived antigens in response to the above chemokines. Consistently, the cellularity of CD14(+)moDC is diminished in mice with MyD88-deficient TECs, in which the frequency and functionality of thymic CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs are decreased, leading to aggravated mouse experimental colitis. Thus, our findings describe a TLR-dependent function of mTECs for the recruitment of CD14(+)moDC, the generation of Tregs, and thereby the establishment of central tolerance. Immune tolerance is mediated by the deletion of autoreactive T cells via medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) and dendritic cells (DC), and by the induction of regulatory T cells (Treg). Here the authors show that mTEC receiving toll-like receptor signaling control the recruitment of CD14(+)Sirp alpha (+) DC population that is capable of inducing Treg for establishing tolerance.",30102.0,"Vobořil, Matouš:Brabec, Tomáš:Dobeš, Jan:Šplíchalová, Iva:Březina, Jiří:Čepková, Adéla:Dobešová, Martina:Aidarova, Aigerim:Kubovčiak, Jan:Tsyklauri, Oksana:Štěpánek, Ondřej:Beneš, V.:Sedláček, Radislav:Klein, L.:Kolář, Michal:Filipp, Dominik",Nature Communications,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Differences in midlatitude ionospheric response to magnetic disturbances at northern and southern hemispheres and anomalous response during the last extreme solar minimum,"In order to give users reliable information/warning of changing space weather conditions that may affect a diverse range of technological systems, thoroughgoing knowledge of disturbed ionosphere behavior and its solar activity, local time, seasonal, latitudinal/longitudinal dependence, as well as possible hemispherical asymmetries are needed. Here investigations of differences in ionospheric effects are based on data obtained at different magnetic latitudes and longitudes of both hemispheres. Variability of main ionospheric parameters (foF2 and hmF2), obtained for Euro‐African and American sectors for geomagnetic storms of different intensity, which occurred within solar cycles 23 and 24, is analyzed. Ionospheric response to weak geomagnetic storms during the declining phase of the 23rd solar cycle and deep 23/24 solar minimum is found to be comparable with or even slightly stronger than that of strong storms under higher solar activity conditions, which might be partly related to specific impact of different drivers of geomagnetic activity. Hemispheric asymmetry of ionospheric response at middle latitudes, on average, is not a dominant and/or strong feature. The asymmetry in individual events may be well pronounced both in foF2 and hmF2, but mostly it seems to be an impact of other factors like seasonal variation, magnetic coordinates, or local time.",10509.0,"Burešová, Dalia:Laštovička, Jan",Ionospheric Space Weather: Longitude Dependence and Lower Atmosphere Forcing,1,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is academic tracking related to gains in learning competence?

Propensity score matching is used to form parallelized samples of academic and non-academic track students and to eliminate the effect of selective school intake. We applied regression models on the total scores to test for the overall track effect. Furthermore, we analyze scores and gains on the subscores and check for differential item functioning in Grade 6 and in change to Grade 9. While after 3 years, no significant difference between the two tracks was apparent in the total learning competence score, we did, however, find significant differences in some subscores and in the functioning of some items.

"Chronology of the Kašperské Hory orogenic gold deposit, Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic","The Kašperské Hory deposit represents one of the economically most important hydrothermal gold deposits in the Bohemian Massif (Czech Republic). We present new Re–Os age determinations for sulfides complemented by Ar–Ar determinations on silicate minerals in order to provide temporal constraints on the deposit formation. Arsenopyrite and molybdenite formed during gold-bearing stages I–III yielded similar Re–Os ages between ~ 341 and 333 Ma, overlapping with the Ar–Ar cooling age of the metamorphic host rocks below ~ 500 °C. Continuous cooling of the ore system below 270 °C during stage III is reflected by Ar–Ar muscovite ages spanning from ~ 332 to 325 Ma representing the long interval of formation of gold-productive stage III. Thus, the Kašperské Hory gold deposit is younger than the gold deposits spatially associated with the Central Bohemian Plutonic Complex (~ 349–339 Ma) belonging to the Central Bohemian Metallogenetic Zone (e.g., Mokrsko-West, Jílové, Petráčkova Hora).

Unique double concentric ring organization of light harvesting complexes in Gemmatimonas phototrophica,"The majority of life on Earth depends directly or indirectly on the sun as a source of energy.

Using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we determined the energy transfer time between these spectral bands as 2 ps. Single particle analyses of the purified complexes showed that they were circular structures with an outer diameter of approximately 18 nm and a thickness of 7 nm. Based on the obtained, we propose that the LH complexes in G. phototrophica form 2 concentric rings surrounding the type 2 RC. The inner ring (corresponding to the B868 absorption band) is composed of 15 subunits and is analogous to the inner light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1) in purple bacteria. The outer ring is composed of 15 more distant BChl dimers with no or slow energy transfer between them, resulting in the B816 absorption band. This completely unique and elegant organization offers good structural stability, as well as high efficiency of light harvesting. Our results reveal that while the PS apparatus of Gemmatimonadetes was acquired via horizontal gene transfer from purple bacteria, it later evolved along its own pathway, devising a new arrangement of its light harvesting complexes.",10610.0,"Dachev, Marko:Bína, David:Sobotka, Roman:Moravcová, Lenka:Gardian, Zdenko:Kaftan, David:Šlouf, V.:Fuciman, M.:Polívka, Tomáš:Koblížek, Michal",PLOS BIOLOGY,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

GLI1-expressing mesenchymal cells form the essential Wnt-secreting niche for colon stem cells,"Wnt-beta-catenin signalling plays a pivotal role in the homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium by promoting stem cell renewal(1,2). In the small intestine, epithelial Paneth cells secrete Wnt ligands and thus adopt the function of the stem cell niche to maintain epithelial homeostasis(3,4). It is unclear which cells comprise the stem cell niche in the colon. Here we show that subepithelial mesenchymal GLI1-expressing cells form this essential niche. Blocking Wnt secretion from GLI1-expressing cells prevents colonic stem cell renewal in mice: the stem cells are lost and, as a consequence, the integrity of the colonic epithelium is corrupted, leading to death. GLI1-expressing cells also play an important role in the maintenance of the small intestine, where they serve as a reserve Wnt source that becomes critical when Wnt secretion from epithelial cells is prevented. Our data suggest a mechanism by which the stem cell niche is adjusted to meet the needs of the intestine via adaptive changes in the number of mesenchymal GLI1-expressing cells.",10608.0,"Degirmenci, B.:Valenta, Tomáš:Dimitrieva, S.:Hausmann, G.:Basler, K.",Nature,1,high,high,0,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Expansion microscopy facilitates quantitative super-resolution studies of cytoskeletal structures in kinetoplastid parasites,"Expansion microscopy (ExM) has become a powerful super-resolution method in cell biology. It is a simple, yet robust approach, which does not require any instrumentation or reagents beyond those present in a standard microscopy facility. In this study, we used kinetoplastid parasites Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major, which possess a complex, yet well-defined microtubule-based cytoskeleton, to demonstrate that this method recapitulates faithfully morphology of structures as previously revealed by a combination of sophisticated electron microscopy (EM) approaches. Importantly, we also show that due to the rapidness of image acquisition and three-dimensional reconstruction of cellular volumes ExM is capable of complementing EM approaches by providing more quantitative data. This is demonstrated on examples of less well-appreciated microtubule structures, such as the neck microtubule of T. brucei or the pocket, cytosolic and multivesicular tubule-associated microtubules of L. major. We further demonstrate that ExM enables identifying cell types rare in a population, such as cells in mitosis and cytokinesis. Three-dimensional reconstruction of an entire volume of these cells provided details on the morphology of the mitotic spindle and the cleavage furrow. Finally, we show that established antibody markers of major cytoskeletal structures function well in ExM, which together with the ability to visualize proteins tagged with small epitope tags will facilitate studies of the kinetoplastid cytoskeleton.",10608.0,"Gorilák, Peter:Pružincová, Martina:Váchová, Hana:Olsinova, M.:Schmidt Černohorská, Markéta:Varga, Vladimír",Open Biology,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Atomic Scale Control and Visualization of Topological Quantum Phase Transition in π-Conjugated Polymers Driven by Their Length,"Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) driven by quantum fluctuations are transitions between distinct quantum phases of matter. At present, they are poorly understood and not readily controlled. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) are used to explore atomic scale control over quantum phase transitions between two different topological quantum states of a well-defined pi-conjugated polymer. The phase transition is driven by a pseudo Jahn-Teller effect that is activated above a certain polymer chain length. In addition, theoretical calculations indicate the presence of long-lasting coherent fluctuations between the polymer&apos,s two quantum phases near the phase transition, at finite temperature. This work thus presents a new way of exploring atomic-scale control over QPTs and indicates that emerging quantum criticality in the vicinity of a QPT can give rise to new states of organic matter.",21001.0,"Gonzalez-Herrero, Hector:Mendieta-Moreno, Jesus I.:Edalatmanesh, Shayan:De La Torre, Bruno:Jelínek, Pavel",ADVANCED MATERIALS,1,high,high,0,0,medium,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, the physical mechanisms and biochemical pathways underlying the effects of non-thermal plasma on bacteria and cell fate have still not been fully explored. Here, we report on the molecular mechanisms of non-thermal plasma-induced bacteria inactivation in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains.

Novel CHK1 inhibitor MU380 exhibits significant single-agent activity in TP53-mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells,"Introduction of small-molecule inhibitors of B-cell receptor signaling and BCL2 protein significantly improves therapeutic options in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, some patients suffer from adverse effects mandating treatment discontinuation, and cases with TP53 defects more frequently experience early progression of the disease. Development of alternative therapeutic approaches is, therefore, of critical importance. Here we report details of the anti-chronic lymphocytic leukemia single-agent activity of MU380, our recently identified potent, selective, and metabolically robust inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1. We also describe a newly developed enantioselective synthesis of MU380, which allows preparation of gram quantities of the substance. Checkpoint kinase 1 is a master regulator of replication operating primarily in intra-S and G(2)/M cell cycle checkpoints. Initially tested in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, MU380 significantly potentiated efficacy of gemcitabine, a clinically used inducer of replication stress. Moreover, MU380 manifested substantial single-agent activity in both TP53-wild type and TP53-mutated leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived cell lines MEC-1, MEC-2 (both TP53-mut), and OSU-CLL (TP53-wt) the inhibitor impaired cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. In primary clinical samples, MU380 used as a single-agent noticeably reduced the viability of unstimulated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells as well as those induced to proliferate by anti-CD40/IL-4 stimuli. In both cases, effects were comparable in samples harboring p53 pathway dysfunction (TP53 mutations or ATM mutations) and TP53-wt/ATM-wt cells. Lastly, MU380 also exhibited significant in vivo activity in a xenotransplant mouse model (immunodeficient strain NOD-scid IL2R gamma(null)) where it efficiently suppressed growth of subcutaneous tumors generated from MEC-1 cells.",30205.0,"Boudný, Miroslav:Zemanová, Jana:Khirsariya, PrashantKumar:Borský, Marek:Verner, Jan:Černá, Jana:Oltova, Alexandra:Šeda, Václav:Mráz, Marek:Jaroš, Josef:Jašková, Zuzana:Špunarová, Michaela:Brychtová, Yvona:Souček, Karel:Drápela, Stanislav:Kašpárková, Marie:Mayer, Jiří:Paruch, Kamil:Trbušek, Martin",Haematologica,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
A continuum model of heterogeneous catalysis: Thermodynamic framework for multicomponent bulk and surface phenomena coupled by sorption,"We derive a thermodynamically consistent model of heterogeneous catalysis for chemically reacting fluid mixtures formulated in the framework of continuum thermodynamics. The model takes into account standard transport phenomena in the bulk domain and involves mass transfer of the species between the bulk and the catalytic (active) part of the boundary where the surface counterparts to the bulk transport processes take place. Concerning the balance laws on the catalytic surface, the model benefits from description of the active part of the boundary as an interface between the bulk domain and its exterior which allows to employ the framework of continuum mechanics with interfacial transport phenomena. The constitutive relations involving vectorial and tensorial quantities such as the Cauchy stress, energy and entropy fluxes and diffusive fluxes relevant to individual constituents are constructed in a systematic manner ensuring compatibility with the second law of thermodynamics. The constitutive procedure follows from the specification of constitutive equations for suitable thermodynamic potentials (free energies) of the mixture in the bulk and on the active part of the boundary and from the identification of the bulk and surface entropy productions. The active part of the boundary is described by means of statistical physics and this description then serves as a building block for the derivation of surface continuum thermodynamic potentials. The derived model is suitable for further mathematical, numerical and computational analysis of relevant initial and boundary value problems. While the model employs a relatively simple description of the active part of the boundary as a monolayer lattice with single-site Langmuir-type adsorption, its detailed derivation presented here provides clear guidelines for the incorporation of other sorption models.

Decomposer food web in a deciduous forest shows high share of generalist microorganisms and importance of microbial biomass recycling,"Forest soils represent important terrestrial carbon (C) pools where C is primarily fixed in the plant-derived biomass but it flows further through the biomass of fungi and bacteria before it is lost from the ecosystem as CO2 or immobilized in recalcitrant organic matter. Microorganisms are the main drivers of C flow in forests and play critical roles in the C balance through the decomposition of dead biomass of different origins. Here, we track the path of C that enters forest soil by following respiration, microbial biomass production, and C accumulation by individual microbial taxa in soil microcosms upon the addition of C-13-labeled biomass of plant, fungal, and bacterial origin. We demonstrate that both fungi and bacteria are involved in the assimilation and mineralization of C from the major complex sources existing in soil. Decomposer fungi are, however, better suited to utilize plant biomass compounds, whereas the ability to utilize fungal and bacterial biomass is more frequent among bacteria. Due to the ability of microorganisms to recycle microbial biomass, we suggest that the decomposer food web in forest soil displays a network structure with loops between and within individual pools. These results question the present paradigms describing food webs as hierarchical structures with unidirectional flow of C and assumptions about the dominance of fungi in the decomposition of complex organic matter.",10606.0,"López-Mondejár, Rubén:Brabcová, Vendula:Štursová, Martina:Davidová, Anna:Jansa, Jan:Cajthaml, Tomáš:Baldrian, Petr",The ISME Journal,1,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Novel long‐acting antagonists of muscarinic ACh receptors,"The aim of this study was to develop potent and long-acting antagonists of muscarinic ACh receptors. The 4-hexyloxy and 4-butyloxy derivatives of 1-[2-(4-oxidobenzoyloxy)ethyl]-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-1-ium were synthesized and tested for biological activity. Antagonists with long-residence time at receptors are therapeutic targets for the treatment of several neurological and psychiatric human diseases. Their long-acting effects allow for reduced daily doses and adverse effects. The binding and antagonism of functional responses to the agonist carbachol mediated by 4-hexyloxy compounds were investigated in CHO cells expressing individual subtypes of muscarinic receptors and compared with 4-butyloxy analogues. The 4-hexyloxy derivatives were found to bind muscarinic receptors with micromolar affinity and antagonized the functional response to carbachol with a potency ranging from 30 nM at M-1 to 4 mu M at M-3 receptors. Under washing conditions to reverse antagonism, the half-life of their antagonistic action ranged from 1.7 h at M-2 to 5h at M-5 receptors. The 4-hexyloxy derivatives were found to be potent long-acting M-1-preferring antagonists.

Network based definition of functional regions: A graph theory approach for spatial distribution of traffic flows,"Functional regions are autonomous (internally coherent and externally self-contained) spatial structures based on vector data, so-called spatial interactions. Typically, travel-to-work, travel-to-school flows and migrations are analysed by various methods of functional regional taxonomy in order to define functional regions. There is still another type of statistically recorded vector data which has, up to now, rarely been used for this purpose: traffic flows. However, these data differ distinctly from the above mentioned flows. In this paper we pursue two objectives: (i) to define functional transport regions based on a graph theoretic analysis of individual traffic flows, and (ii) to add knowledge to the issue of the self-containment of functional transport regions. The specific nature of transport data compared to the above-mentioned spatial interactions requires a specific methodological approach, which is presented in the paper. The existing graph theoretic procedures do not seem suitable for the definition of functional transport regions due to data specifics. Therefore our analysis is based on a rough analogy to the minimum cut method – we identify minimum flows in a graph representing a transport network. The territory of the Czech Republic is used as the example. Two regional systems are defined (based on 2000 and 2016 data) and compared in time. The paper achieves two main findings. First, the proposed methodological approach allows us to define autonomous functional transport regions, and the means to calculate their self-containment is discussed. Second, functional transport regions in the Czech Republic show unexpected stability over time compared to functional regions based on such spatial interactions as commuting flows.",50701.0,"Klapka, Pavel:Kraft, Stanislav:Halás, Marián",Journal of Transport Geography,1,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Physics conclusions in support of ITER W divertor monoblock shaping,"The key remaining physics design issue for the ITER tungsten (W) divertor is the question of monoblock (MB) front surface shaping in the high heat flux target areas of the actively cooled targets. Engineering tolerance specifications impose a challenging maximum radial step between toroidally adjacent MBs of 0.3 mm. Assuming optical projection of the parallel heat loads, magnetic shadowing of these edges is required if quasi-steady state melting is to be avoided under certain conditions during burning plasma operation and transiently during edge localized mode (ELM) or disruption induced power loading. An ex- periment on JET in 2013 designed to investigate the consequences of transient W edge melting on ITER, found significant deficits in the edge power loads expected on the basis of simple geometric arguments, throwing doubt on the understanding of edge loading at glancing field line angles. As a result, a coordi- nated multi-experiment and simulation effort was initiated via the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) and through ITER contracts, aimed at improving the physics basis supporting a MB shaping deci- sion from the point of view both of edge power loading and melt dynamics. This paper reports on the outcome of this activity, concluding first that the geometrical approximation for leading edge power load- ing on radially misaligned poloidal leading edges is indeed valid. On this basis, the behaviour of shaped and unshaped monoblock surfaces under stationary and transient loads, with and without melting, is compared in order to examine the consequences of melting, or power overload in context of the benefit, or not, of shaping. The paper concludes that MB top surface shaping is recommended to shadow poloidal gap edges in the high heat flux areas of the ITER divertor targets.",10305.0,"Pitts, R.A.:Bardin, S.:Bazylev, B.:van den Berg, M.A.:Bunting, P.:Carpentier-Chouchana, S.:Coenen, J.W.:Corre, Y.:Dejarnac, Renaud:Escourbiac, F.:Gaspar, J.:Gunn, J.

Literature searches of the Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE databases included January 1, 1992, through April 2020 identified pertinent articles for review. Because of the lack of high-quality data from randomized clinical trials or large observational studies, recommendations were formulated based on consensus of contributors and medical societies that represented relevant disciplines, including critical care, neurology, and neurosurgery. Evidence Synthesis Based on review of the literature and consensus from a large multidisciplinary, international panel, minimum clinical criteria needed to determine BD/DNC in various circumstances were developed. Recommendations Prior to evaluating a patient for BD/DNC, the patient should have an established neurologic diagnosis that can lead to the complete and irreversible loss of all brain function, and conditions that may confound the clinical examination and diseases that may mimic BD/DNC should be excluded. Determination of BD/DNC can be done with a clinical examination that demonstrates coma, brainstem areflexia, and apnea. This is seen when (1) there is no evidence of arousal or awareness to maximal external stimulation, including noxious visual, auditory, and tactile stimulation, (2) pupils are fixed in a midsize or dilated position and are nonreactive to light, (3) corneal, oculocephalic, and oculovestibular reflexes are absent, (4) there is no facial movement to noxious stimulation, (5) the gag reflex is absent to bilateral posterior pharyngeal stimulation, (6) the cough reflex is absent to deep tracheal suctioning, (7) there is no brain-mediated motor response to noxious stimulation of the limbs, and (8) spontaneous respirations are not observed when apnea test targets reach pH &lt,7.30 and Paco2 GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO60 mm Hg. If the clinical examination cannot be completed, ancillary testing may be considered with blood flow studies or electrophysiologic testing. Special consideration is needed for children, for persons receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and for those receiving therapeutic hypothermia, as well as for factors such as religious, societal, and cultural perspectives, legal requirements, and resource availability. Conclusions and Relevance This report provides recommendations for the minimum clinical standards for determination of brain death/death by neurologic criteria in adults and children with clear guidance for various clinical circumstances. The recommendations have widespread international society endorsement and can serve to guide professional societies and countries in the revision or development of protocols and procedures for determination of brain death/death by neurologic criteria, leading to greater consistency within and between countries.",30218.0,"Černý, Vladimír:Greer, David M.:Shemie, Sam D.:Lewis, Ariane:Torrance, Sylvia:Varelas, Panayiotis:Goldenberg, Fernando D.:Bernat, James L.:Souter, Michael:Topcuoglu, Mehmet Akif:Alexandrov, Anne W.:Baldisseri, Marie:Bleck, Thomas:Citerio, Giuseppe:Dawson, Rosanne:Hoppe, Arnold:Jacobe, Stephem:Manara, Alex:Nakagawa, Thomas A.:Pope, Thaddeus Mason:Silvester, William:Thomson, David:Al Rahma, Hussain:Badenes, Rafael:Baker, Andrew J.:Chang, Cherylee:Chang, Tiffany R.:Gnedovskaya, Elena:Han, Moon-Ku:Honeybul, Stephen:Jimenez, Edgar:Kuroda, Yasuhiro:Liu, Gang:Mallick, Uzzwal Kumar:Marquevich, Victoria:Mejia-Mantilla, Jorge:Piradov, Michael:Quayyum, Sarah:Shrestha, Gentle Sunder:Su, Ying-ying:Timmons, Shelly D.:Teitelbaum, Jeanne:Videtta, Walter:Zirpe, Kapil:Sung, Gene",JAMA : The Journal of the American Medical Association,1,low,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Mutations in ATP1A1 Cause Dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 2,"Although mutations in more than 90 genes are known to cause CMT, the underlying genetic cause of CMT remains unknown in more than 50% of affected individuals. The discovery of additional genes that harbor CMT2-causing mutations increasingly depends on sharing sequence data on a global level. In this way-by combining data from seven countries on four continents-we were able to define mutations in ATP1A1, which encodes the alpha1 subunit of the Na+, K+-ATPase, as a cause of autosomal-dominant CMT2. Seven missense changes were identified that segregated within individual pedigrees: c.143T&gt,G (p.Leu48Arg), c.1775T&gt,C (p.Ile592Thr), c.1789G&gt,A (p.Ala597Thr), c.1801_1802delinsTT (p.Asp601Phe), c.1798C&gt,G (p.Pro600Ala), c.1798C&gt,A (p.Pro600Thr), and c.2432A&gt,C (p.Asp811Ala). Immunostaining peripheral nerve axons localized ATP1A1 to the axolemma of myelinated sensory and motor axons and to Schmidt-Lanterman incisures of myelin sheaths. Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements on Xenopus oocytes demonstrated significant reduction in Na+ current activity in some, but not all, ouabain-insensitive ATP1A1 mutants, suggesting a loss-of-function defect of the Na+, K+ pump. Five mutants fall into a remarkably narrow motif within the helical linker region that couples the nucleotide-binding and phosphorylation domains. These findings identify a CMT pathway and a potential target for therapy development in degenerative diseases of peripheral nerve axons.",30103.0,"Laššuthová, Petra:Rebelo, Adriana P.:Ravenscroft, Gianina:Lamont, Phillipa J.:Davis, Mark R.:Manganelli, Fiore:Feely, Shawna M.:Bacon, Chelsea:Šafka Brožková, Dana:Haberlová, Jana:Mazanec, Radim:Tao, Feifei:Saghira, Cima:Abreu, Lisa:Courel, Steve:Powell, Eric:Buglo, Elena:Bis, Dana M.:Baxter, Megan F.:Ong, Royston W.:Marns, Lorna:Lee, Yi-Chung:Bai, Yunhong:Isom, Daniel G.:Barro-Soria, Rene:Chung, Ki W.:Scherer, Steven S.:Larsson, H.

RNA Structural Dynamics As Captured by Molecular Simulations: A Comprehensive Overview,"With both catalytic and genetic functions, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is perhaps the most pluripotent chemical species in molecular biology, and its functions are intimately linked to its structure and dynamics. Computer simulations, and in particular atomistic molecular dynamics (MD), allow structural dynamics of biomolecular systems to be investigated with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We here provide a comprehensive overview of the fast-developing field of MD simulations of RNA molecules. We begin with an in-depth, evaluatory coverage of the most fundamental methodological challenges that set the basis for the future development of the field, in particular, the current developments and inherent physical limitations of the atomistic force fields and the recent advances in a broad spectrum of enhanced sampling methods. We also survey the closely related field of coarse-grained modeling of RNA systems. After dealing with the methodological aspects, we provide an exhaustive overview of the available RNA simulation literature, ranging from studies of the smallest RNA oligonucleotides to investigations of the entire ribosome. Our review encompasses tetranucleotides, tetraloops, a number of small RNA motifs, A-helix RNA, kissing-loop complexes, the TAR RNA element, the decoding center and other important regions of the ribosome, as well as assorted others systems. Extended sections are devoted to RNA-ion interactions, ribozymes, riboswitches, and protein/RNA complexes. Our overview is written for as broad of an audience as possible, aiming to provide a much-needed interdisciplinary bridge between computation and experiment, together with a perspective on the future of the field.",10403.0,"Šponer, Jiří:Bussi, Giovanni:Krepl, Miroslav:Banáš, Pavel:Bottaro, Sandro:Cunha, Richard André:Gil-Ley, Alejandro:Pinamonti, Giovanni:Poblete, Simón:Jurečka, Petr:Walter, Nils G:Otyepka, Michal",CHEMICAL REVIEWS,1,medium,high,0,1,high,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Similarity of introduced plant species to native ones facilitates naturalization, but differences enhance invasion success","The search for traits associated with plant invasiveness has yielded contradictory results, in part because most previous studies have failed to recognize that different traits are important at different stages along the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum. Here we show that across six different habitat types in temperate Central Europe, naturalized non-invasive species are functionally similar to native species occurring in the same habitat type, but invasive species are different as they occupy the edge of the plant functional trait space represented in each habitat. This pattern was driven mainly by the greater average height of invasive species. These results suggest that the primary determinant of successful establishment of alien species in resident plant communities is environmental filtering, which is expressed in similar trait distributions. However, to become invasive, established alien species need to be different enough to occupy novel niche space, i.e. the edge of trait space.",10700.0,"Divíšek, Jan:Chytrý, Milan:Beckage,, Brian:Gotelli, Nicholas J.:Lososová, Zdeňka:Pyšek, Petr:Richardson, David M.:Molofsky, Jane",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Short- and long-term outcomes of alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in patients with mild left ventricular hypertrophy: a propensity score matching analysis,"AIMS: Based on European guidelines, alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is indicated only in patients with interventricular septum (IVS) thickness &gt,16 mm. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes in ASA patients with mild hypertrophy (IVS &lt,= 16 mm). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 1505 consecutive ASA patients and used propensity score to match 172 pairs (344 patients) in groups IVS &lt,= 16 mm or IVS &gt, 16 mm. There was no occurrence of post-ASA ventriculoseptal defect in the whole cohort (n = 1505). Matched patients had 30-day mortality rate 0% in IVS &lt,= 16 mm group and 0.6% in IVS &gt, 16 mm group (P = 1). Patients in IVS &lt,= 16 mm group had more ASA-attributable early complications (16% vs. 9%, P = 0.049), which was driven by higher need for pacemaker implantation (13% vs. 8%, P = 0.22). The mean follow-up was 5.4 +- 4.3 years and the annual all-cause mortality rate was 1.8 and 3.2 deaths per 100-patient-years in IVS &lt,= 16 group and IVS &gt, 16 group, respectively (log-rank test P = 0.04). There were no differences in symptom relief and left ventricular (LV) gradient reduction. Patients with IVS &lt,= 16 mm had less repeated septal reduction procedures (log-rank test P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Selected patients with HOCM and mild hypertrophy (IVS &lt,= 16 mm) had more early post-ASA complications driven by need for pacemaker implantation, but their long-term survival is better than in patients with IVS &gt,16 mm. While relief of symptoms and LV obstruction reduction is similar in both groups, a need for repeat septal reduction is higher in patients with IVS &gt, 16 mm.

Pathogenic ARH3 mutations result in ADP-ribose chromatin scars during DNA strand break repair,"Neurodegeneration is a common hallmark of individuals with hereditary defects in DNA single-strand break repair, a process regulated by poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism. Recently, mutations in the ARH3 (ADPRHL2) hydrolase that removes ADP-ribose from proteins have been associated with neurodegenerative disease. Here, we show that ARH3-mutated patient cells accumulate mono(ADP-ribose) scars on core histones that are a molecular memory of recently repaired DNA single-strand breaks. We demonstrate that the ADP-ribose chromatin scars result in reduced endogenous levels of important chromatin modifications such as H3K9 acetylation, and that ARH3 patient cells exhibit measurable levels of deregulated transcription. Moreover, we show that the mono(ADP-ribose) scars are lost from the chromatin of ARH3-defective cells in the prolonged presence of PARP inhibition, and concomitantly that chromatin acetylation is restored to normal. Collectively, these data indicate that ARH3 can act as an eraser of ADP-ribose chromatin scars at sites of PARP activity during DNA single-strand break repair.",10601.0,"Hanzlíková, Hana:Prokhorova, E.:Krejčíková, Kateřina:Cíhlářová, Zuzana:Kalasová, Ilona:Kubovčiak, Jan:Šáchová, Jana:Hailstone, R.:Brazina, J.:Ghosh, S.:Cirak, S.:Gleeson, J.

Bark Beetle Outbreaks in Europe: State of Knowledge and Ways Forward for Management,"Purpose of Review Outbreaks of tree-killing bark beetles have reached unprecedented levels in conifer forests in the northern hemisphere and are expected to further intensify due to climate change. In parts of Europe, bark beetle outbreaks and efforts to manage them have even triggered social unrests and political instability. These events have increasingly challenged traditional responses to outbreaks, and highlight the need for a more comprehensive management framework. Recent Findings Several synthesis papers on different aspects of bark beetle ecology and management exist. However, our understanding of outbreak drivers and impacts, principles of ecosystem management, governance, and the role of climate change in the dynamics of ecological and social systems has rapidly advanced in recent years. These advances are suggesting a reconsideration of previous management strategies.

Accurate simulation of transcranial ultrasound propagation for ultrasonic neuromodulation and stimulation,"Non-invasive, focal neurostimulation with ultrasound is a potentially powerful neuroscientific tool that requires effective transcranial focusing of ultrasound to develop. Time-reversal (TR) focusing using numerical simulations of transcranial ultrasound propagation can correct for the effect of the skull, but relies on accurate simulations. Here, focusing requirements for ultrasonic neurostimulation are established through a review of previously employed ultrasonic parameters, and consideration of deep brain targets. The specific limitations of finite-difference time domain (FDTD) and k-space corrected pseudospectral time domain (PSTD) schemes are tested numerically to establish the spatial points per wavelength and temporal points per period needed to achieve the desired accuracy while minimizing the computational burden. These criteria are confirmed through convergence testing of a fully simulated TR protocol using a virtual skull. The k-space PSTD scheme performed as well as, or better than, the widely used FDTD scheme across all individual error tests and in the convergence of large scale models, recommending it for use in simulated TR. Staircasing was shown to be the most serious source of error. Convergence testing indicated that higher sampling is required to achieve fine control of the pressure amplitude at the target than is needed for accurate spatial targeting.",10307.0,"Robertson, James:Cox, Ben:Jaroš, Jiří:Treeby, Bradley",Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1-Year Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Primary Angioplasty for Myocardial Infarction Treated With Prasugrel Versus Ticagrelor,"BACKGROUND Early outcomes of patients in the PRAGUE-18 (Comparison of Prasugrel and Ticagrelor in the Treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction) study did not find any significant differences between 2 potent P2Y(12) inhibitors. OBJECTIVES The 1-year follow-up of the PRAGUE-18 study focused on: 1) a comparison of efficacy and safety between prasugrel and ticagrelor, and 2) the risk of major ischemic events related to an economically motivated post-discharge switch to clopidogrel. METHODS A total of 1,230 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to prasugrel or ticagrelor with an intended treatment duration of 12 months. The combined endpoint was cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke at 1 year. Because patients had to cover the costs of study medication after hospital discharge, some patients decided to switch to clopidogrel. RESULTS The endpoint occurred in 6.6% of prasugrel patients and in 5.7% of ticagrelor patients (hazard ratio: 1.167, 95% confidence interval: 0.742 to 1.835, p = 0.503). No significant differences were found in: cardiovascular death (3.3% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.769), MI (3.0% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.611), stroke (1.1% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.423), all-cause death (4.7% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.654), definite stent thrombosis (1.1% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.535), all bleeding (10.9% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.999), and TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding (0.9% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.754). The percentage of patients who switched to clopidogrel for economic reasons was 34.1% (n = 216) for prasugrel and 44.4% (n = 265) for ticagrelor (p = 0.003). Patients who were economically motivated to switch to clopidogrel had (compared with patients who continued the study medications) a lower risk of major cardiovascular events, however, they also had lower ischemic risk. CONCLUSIONS Prasugrel and ticagrelor are similarly effective during the first year after MI. Economically motivated early post-discharge switches to clopidogrel were not associated with an increased risk of ischemic events.

Modelling prehistoric settlement activities based on surface and subsurface surveys,"This study resumes our research into variations in settlement patterns from the Neolithic to the Migration Period (5600 BC–570 AD). After using a large dataset of less precisely localized finds from the Czech Republic, we now examine data from large-scale surface surveys. The higher spatial precision allows us to analyse settlement activities in terms of quantity, size, duration, continuity, stability and degree of complexity. First, we analysed the data using descriptive methods regarding its spatial structure, dating and environmental setting. We assessed the possibility of integrating data from surface and subsurface research. In the second stage, we reconstructed possible configurations of habitation areas and their adjacent primary production areas (settlement cores) and chronologically ordered the finds using algorithmic modelling. A more detailed phasing transcending the chronological resolution of the data was achieved by using mutual spatial exclusion of settlement cores as a chronological marker. The resulting ordering was then analysed using probabilistic methods. The results portray the intensity of settlement activities during various periods as well as changes in their structural organization. The observed patterns suggest higher-order social organization starting in the Early Bronze Age, culminating in the Final Bronze Age followed by a gradual decline. In later periods, we observe hot spots in the landscape with stable habitation over hundreds of years.

Fast room temperature lability of aluminosilicate zeolites,"Aluminosilicate zeolites are traditionally used in high-temperature applications at low water vapour pressures where the zeolite framework is generally considered to be stable and static. Increasingly, zeolites are being considered for applications under milder aqueous conditions. However, it has not yet been established how neutral liquid water at mild conditions affects the stability of the zeolite framework. Here, we show that covalent bonds in the zeolite chabazite (CHA) are labile when in contact with neutral liquid water, which leads to partial but fully reversible hydrolysis without framework degradation. We present ab initio calculations that predict novel, energetically viable reaction mechanisms by which Al-O and Si-O bonds rapidly and reversibly break at 300 K. By means of solid-state NMR, we confirm this prediction, demonstrating that isotopic substitution of (17)O( )in the zeolitic framework occurs at room temperature in less than one hour of contact with enriched water.",10403.0,"Heard, Christopher James:Grajciar, Lukáš:Rice, Cameron M.:Pugh, Suzi M.:Nachtigall, Petr:Ashbrook, Sharon Elizabeth M.:Morris, Russell Edward",Nature Communications [online],1,high,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is significantly larger than the PYTHIA model calculations for p + p collisions. The measured A(c)/D-0 ratio, as a function of p(T) and collision centrality, is comparable to the baryon-to-meson ratios for light and strange hadrons in Au + Au collisions.

Spinal subpial delivery of AAV9 enables widespread gene silencing and blocks motoneuron degeneration in ALS,"Gene silencing with virally delivered shRNA represents a promising approach for treatment of inherited neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study we develop a subpial technique, which we show in adult animals successfully delivers adeno-associated virus (AAV) throughout the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord, as well as brain motor centers. One-time injection at cervical and lumbar levels just before disease onset in mice expressing a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-causing mutant SOD1 produces long-term suppression of motoneuron disease, including near-complete preservation of spinal alpha-motoneurons and muscle innervation.

Subterahertz collective dynamics of polar vortices,"Using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond X-ray diffraction measurements, we observe ultrafast collective polarization dynamics that are unique to polar vortices earlier shown to have topology of 2D skyrmions. A previously unseen tunable mode, hereafter referred to as a vortexon, emerges in the form of transient arrays of nanoscale circular patterns of atomic displacements. Its frequency is considerably reduced (softened) at a critical strain, indicating a condensation (freezing) of structural dynamics. We use first-principles-based atomistic calculations and phase-field modelling to reveal the microscopic atomic arrangements and corroborate the frequencies of the vortex modes.n",10302.0,"Li, Q.:Stoica, V.A.:Pasciak, Marek:Zhu, Y.:Yuan, Y.:Yang, T.N.:McCarter, M.R.:Das, S.:Yadav, A.K.:Park, S.:Dai, C.:Lee, H.

On the other hand, and at the same time, we are interested in a much more general theoretical and methodological question, namely, how precisely this type of question may and should be investigated: What procedures and what kind of data are appropriate, and especially: What is the status of concepts that we use in such a comparative study?

Mature dendritic cells correlate with favorable immune infiltrate and improved prognosis in ovarian carcinoma patients,"A high density of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and CD20(+) B cells correlates with prolonged survival in patients with a wide variety of human cancers, including high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC). However, the potential impact of mature dendritic cells (DCs) in shaping the immune contexture of HGSC, their role in the establishment of T cell-dependent antitumor immunity, and their potential prognostic value for HGSC patients remain unclear. We harnessed immunohistochemical tests and biomolecular analyses to demonstrate that a high density of tumor-infiltrating DC-LAMP(+) DCs is robustly associated with an immune contexture characterized by T(H)1 polarization and cytotoxic activity. We showed that both mature DCs and CD20(+) B cells play a critical role in the generation of a clinically-favorable cytotoxic immune response in HGSC microenvironment. In line with this notion, robust tumor infiltration by both DC-LAMP(+) DCs and CD20(+) B cells was associated with most favorable overall survival in two independent cohorts of chemotherapy-naive HGSC patients. Our findings suggest that the presence of mature, DC-LAMP(+) DCs in the tumor microenvironment may represent a novel, powerful prognostic biomarker for HGSC patients that reflects the activation of clinically-relevant anticancer immunity.",30204.0,"Truxová, Iva:Kašíková, Lenka:Hensler, Michal:Škapa, Petr:Laco, Jan:Pecen, Ladislav:Belicová, Lucie:Práznovec, Ivan:Halaška, Michael J.:Brtnický, Tomáš:Šálková, Eva:Rob, Lukáš:Kodet, Roman:Goc, Jeremy:Sautes-Fridman, Catherine:Fridman, Wolf Herman:Ryška, Aleš:Galluzzi, Lorenzo:Špíšek, Radek:Fučíková, Jitka",Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Czech Family Stories of Communism: Family Memories at the Intersection of Family Values, Family Relations and National Memory","This chapter of a ground-breaking monograph reveals how family stories operate at the intersection of inner family processes and outer systems such as a national hegemonic discourse about the past. Based on three-generational family stories recounted about the period of communism, the chapter goes beyond demonstrating a critical position of a hegemonic discourse about the past within the process of transmission of social-political values in families. The chapter examines and strives to show, in an interdisciplinary way, how family relations, family legacies and the hegemonic discourse about the past are intertwined. Arguing for a complex interdisciplinary approach towards the study of family memory, the chapter demonstrates under which circumstances and in which ways the stories of family persecution under communist rule may become the sources of family resilience and facilitate a smooth transmission of family legacy to younger generations. On the other hand, family stories immersed in nostalgia, opposing the national discourse, may complicate not only the ambiance in families and relationship between generations, but also a smooth transmission of family legacy to the families’ offspring.",60101.0,"Švaříčková Slabáková, Radmila","Family Memory: Practices, Transmissions and Uses in a Global Perspective",1,medium,high,1,0,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Perspective on light-induced transport of particles: from optical forces to phoretic motion,"Propulsive effects of light. which often remain unnoticed in our daily-life experience. manifest themselves on spatial scales ranging from subatomic to astronomical. Light-mediated forces can indeed confine individual atoms, cooling their effective temperature very close to absolute zero, as well as contribute to cosmological phenomena such as the formation of stellar planetary systems. In this review, we focus on the transport processes that light can initiate on small spatial scales. In particular we discuss in depth various light-induced mechanisms for the controlled transport of microscopic particles, these mechanisms rely on the direct transfer of momentum between the particles and the incident light waves, on the combination of optical forces with external forces of other nature, and on light-triggered phoretic motion. After a concise theoretical overview of the physical origins of optical forces, we describe how these forces can be harnessed to guide particles either in continuous bulk media or in the proximity of a constraining interface under various configurations of the illuminating light beams (radiative, evanescent, or plasmonic fields). Subsequently. we introduce particle transport techniques that complement optical forces with counteracting forces of non-optical nature. We finally discuss particle actuation schemes where light acts as a fine knob to trigger and/or modulate phoretic motion in spatial gradients of non-optical (e.g., electric, chemical, or temperature) fields. We conclude by outlining possible future fundamental and applied directions for research in light-induced particle transport. We believe that this comprehensive review can inspire diverse, interdisciplinary scientific communities to devise novel, unorthodox ways of assembling and manipulating materials with light.",10306.0,"Zemánek, Pavel:Volpe, G.:Jonáš, Alexandr:Brzobohatý, Oto",Advances in Optics and Photonics,1,high,high,0,1,high,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
GM1 Ganglioside Inhibits β-Amyloid Oligomerization Induced by Sphingomyelin,"Beta-Amyloid (Aβ) oligomers are neurotoxic and implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Neuronal plasma membranes may mediate formation of Aβ oligomers in vivo. Membrane components sphingomyelin and GM1 have been shown to promote aggregation of Aβ, however, these studies were performed under extreme, non-physiological conditions. We demonstrate that physiological levels of GM1, organized in nanodomains do not seed oligomerization of Aβ40 monomers. We show that sphingomyelin triggers oligomerization of Aβ40 and that GM1 is counteractive thus preventing oligomerization. We propose a molecular explanation that is supported by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The preventive role of GM1 in the oligomerization of Aβ40 suggests that decreasing levels of GM1 in the brain, for example, due to aging, could reduce protection against Aβ oligomerization and contribute to the onset of Alzheimer's disease.",0.0,"Amaro, Mariana:Šachl, Radek:Aydogan, Gokcan:Mikhalyov, I.:Vácha, R.:Hof, Martin",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,1,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cell-surface receptors enable perception of extracellular cytokinins,"Cytokinins are mobile multifunctional plant hormones with roles in development and stress resilience. Although their Histidine Kinase receptors are substantially localised to the endoplasmic reticulum, cellular sites of cytokinin perception and importance of spatially heterogeneous cytokinin distribution continue to be debated. Here we show that cytokinin perception by plasma membrane receptors is an effective additional path for cytokinin response. Readout from a Two Component Signalling cytokinin-specific reporter (TCSn::GFP) closely matches intracellular cytokinin content in roots, yet we also find cytokinins in extracellular fluid, potentially enabling action at the cell surface. Cytokinins covalently linked to beads that could not pass the plasma membrane increased expression of both TCSn::GFP and Cytokinin Response Factors. Super-resolution microscopy of GFP-labelled receptors and diminished TCSn::GFP response to immobilised cytokinins in cytokinin receptor mutants, further indicate that receptors can function at the cell surface. We argue that dual intracellular and surface locations may augment flexibility of cytokinin responses. The main site of cytokinin perception in plant cells is thought to be the endoplasmic reticulum where most cytokinin receptors localise. Here via the use of bioactive probes that cannot enter plant cells and super-resolution microscopy, Antoniadi et al. show that cytokinin can also be perceived at the plasma membrane.",10611.0,"Antoniadi, Ioanna:Novák, Ondřej:Plíhal, Ondřej:Simerský, Radim:Mik, Václav:Karady, Michal:Plačková, Lenka:Doležal, Karel",Nature Communications,1,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
How to Fight Court-Packing,"Whether we like it or not, court-packing has flourished all over the world. Bolivian, Hungarian, Polish, and Turkish as well as Venezuelan political leaders have recently employed various strategies to stack their courts with loyal judges. Even in consolidated democracies, such as the United States, the possibility of court-packing is discussed with an intensity unheard of for several decades. Yet, our conceptual understanding of the phenomenon is still very limited. This article provides a novel conceptualization of court-packing and identifies three court-packing strategies: (1) the expanding strategy, which includes techniques that increase the size of the court, (2) the emptying strategy, which results in a decrease in the number of sitting judges, and (3) the swapping strategy, which aims at replacing sitting judges. Subsequently, it analyzes the potential safeguards, both formal and informal, against court-packing strategies and shows that formal institutions are rarely enough to fend off court-packing attempts.",50501.0,"Kosař, David:Šipulová, Katarína",Constitutional Studies,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Multi-messenger observations of a binary neutron star merger,"On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors.

From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg(2) at a luminosity distance of 40(-8)(+8) Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M-circle dot. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at similar to 40 Mpc) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope.",10303.0,"Abbott, P.B.:Abbott, R.:Abbott, T.D.:Blažek, Jiří:Boháčová, Martina:Caballero-García, María Dolores:Chudoba, Jiří:Ebr, Jan:Jelínek, Martin:Juryšek, Jakub:Kubánek, Petr:Mandát, Dušan:Palatka, Miroslav:Pech, Miroslav:Prouza, Michael:Řídký, Jan:Martins dos Santos, Eva M.:Schovánek, Petr:Trávníček, Petr:Vícha, Jakub:Yushkov, Alexey",Astrophysical Journal Letters,1,low,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cotargeting of BCL2 with venetoclax and MCL1 with S63845 is synthetically lethal in vivo in relapsed mantle cell lymphoma,"Purpose: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas characterized by (over)expression of BCL2. A BCL2-targeting drug, venetoclax, has promising anticancer activity in MCL. We analyzed molecular mechanisms of venetoclax resistance in MCL cells and tested strategies to overcome it. Experimental Design: We confirmed key roles of proapoptotic proteins BIM and NOXA in mediating venetoclax-induced cell death in MCL. Both BIM and NOXA are, however, differentially expressed in cell lines compared with primary cells. First, NOXA protein is significantly overexpressed in most MCL cell lines. Second, deletions of BIM gene harbored by three commonly used MCL cell lines (JEKO-1, MINO, and Z138) were not found by array comparative genomic hybridization using a validation set of 24 primary MCL samples. Results: We demonstrated that MCL1 and NOXA play important roles in mediating resistance to venetoclax. Consequently, we tested an experimental treatment strategy based on cotargeting BCL2 with venetoclax and MCL1 with a highly specific small-molecule MCL1 inhibitor S63845. The combination of venetoclax and S63845 demonstrated synthetic lethality in vivo on a panel of five patient-derived xenografts established from patients with relapsed MCL with adverse cytogenetics.

Quantitative assessment of motor speech abnormalities in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder,"Objective: Patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) are at substantial risk developing Parkinson’s disease (PD) or related neurodegenerative disorders. Speech is an important indicator of motor function and movement coordination and therefore may be an extremely sensitive early marker of changes due to prodromal neurodegeneration. Methods: Speech data were acquired from 16 RBD subjects and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Objective acoustic assessment of 15 speech dimensions representing various phonatory, articulatory and prosodic deviations was performed. Statistical models were applied to characterize speech disorders in RBD and estimate sensitivity and specificity in differentiating between RBD and control subjects.  Results: Some form of speech impairment was revealed in 88% of RBD subjects. Articulatory deficits were the most prominent findings in RBD. In comparison to controls, RBD group showed significant alteration in irregular alternating motion rates (p=0.009) and articulatory decay (p=0.01). The combination of four distinctive speech dimensions including aperiodicity, irregular alternating motion rates, articulatory decay and dysfluency led to 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity in discriminating between RBD and control subjects. Speech impairment was significantly more pronounced in RBD subjects with the motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale greater than 4 points when compared to other RBD individuals.  Conclusion: Simple quantitative speech motor measures may be suitable for the reliable detection of prodromal neurodegeneration in subjects with RBD, and therefore may provide important outcomes for future therapy trials.",0.0,"Rusz, Jan:Hlavnička, Jan:Tykalová, Tereza:Bušková, J.:Ulmanová, O.:Růžička, E.:Šonka, K.",SLEEP MEDICINE,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
A CRMP4-dependent retrograde axon-to-soma death signal in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal non-cell-autonomous neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons (MNs). Mutations in CRMP4 are associated with ALS in patients, and elevated levels of CRMP4 are suggested to affect MN health in the SOD1G93A-ALS mouse model. However, the mechanism by which CRMP4 mediates toxicity in ALS MNs is poorly understood. Here, by using tissue from human patients with sporadic ALS, MNs derived from C9orf72-mutant patients, and the SOD1G93A-ALS mouse model, we demonstrate that subcellular changes in CRMP4 levels promote MN loss in ALS. First, we show that while expression of CRMP4 protein is increased in cell bodies of ALS-affected MN, CRMP4 levels are decreased in the distal axons. Cellular mislocalization of CRMP4 is caused by increased interaction with the retrograde motor protein, dynein, which mediates CRMP4 transport from distal axons to the soma and thereby promotes MN loss. Blocking the CRMP4-dynein interaction reduces MN loss in human-derived MNs (C9orf72) and in ALS model mice. Thus, we demonstrate a novel CRMP4-dependent retrograde death signal that underlies MN loss in ALS.",30210.0,"Maimon, R.:Ankol, L.:Pery, T.

Meis homeobox genes control progenitor competence in the retina,"The vertebrate eye is derived from the neuroepithelium, surface ectoderm, and extracellular mesenchyme. The neuroepithelium forms an optic cup in which the spatial separation of three domains is established, namely, the region of multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), the ciliary margin zone (CMZ)-which possesses both a neurogenic and nonneurogenic potential-and the optic disk (OD), the interface between the optic stalk and the neuroretina. Here, we show by genetic ablation in the developing optic cup that Meis1 and Meis2 homeobox genes function redundantly to maintain the retinal progenitor pool while they simultaneously suppress the expression of genes characteristic of CMZ and OD fates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Meis transcription factors bind regulatory regions of RPC-, CMZ-, and OD-specific genes, thus providing a mechanistic insight into the Meis-dependent gene regulatory network.

"The discovery of Iberobaeniidae (Coleoptera: Elateroidea): a new family of beetles from Spain, with immatures detected by environmental DNA sequencing","The ongoing exploration of biodiversity and the implementation of new molecular tools continue to unveil hitherto unknown lineages. Here, we report the discovery of three species of neotenic beetles for which we propose the new family Iberobaeniidae. Complete mitochondrial genomes and rRNA genes recovered Iberobaeniidae as a deep branch in Elateroidea, as sister to Lycidae (net-winged beetles). Two species of the new genus Iberobaenia, Iberobaenia minuta sp. nov. and Iberobaenia lencinai sp. nov. were found in the adult stage. In a separate incidence, a related sequence was identified in bulk samples of soil invertebrates subjected to shotgun sequencing and mitogenome assembly, which was traced to a larval voucher specimen of a third species of Iberobaenia. Iberobaenia shows characters shared with other elateroid neotenic lineages, including soft-bodiedness, the hypognathous head, reduced mouthparts with reduced labial palpomeres, and extremely small-bodied males without strengthening structures due to miniaturization. Molecular dating shows that Iberobaeniidae represents an ancient relict lineage originating in the Lower Jurassic, which possibly indicates a long history of neoteny, usually considered to be evolutionarily short-lived. The apparent endemism of Iberobaeniidae in the Mediterranean region highlights the importance of this biodiversity hotspot and the need for further species exploration even in the well-studied European continent.",0.0,"Bocák, Ladislav:Kundrata, Robin:Andújar, Fernández Carmelo:Vogler, Alfried",Proceedings of The Royal Society of London.

PredictSNP2: A Unified Platform for Accurately Evaluating SNP Effects by Exploiting the Different Characteristics of Variants in Distinct Genomic Regions,"An important message taken from human genome sequencing projects is that the human population exhibits approximately 99.9% genetic similarity. Variations in the remaining parts of the genome determine our identity, trace our history and reveal our heritage. The precise delineation of phenotypically causal variants plays a key role in providing accurate personalized diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of inherited diseases. Several computational methods for achieving such delineation have been reported recently. However, their ability to pinpoint potentially deleterious variants is limited by the fact that their mechanisms of prediction do not account for the existence of different categories of variants. Consequently, their output is biased towards the variant categories that are most strongly represented in the variant databases.",0.0,"Bendl, Jaroslav:Musil, Miloš:Štourač, Jan:Zendulka, Jaroslav:Damborský, Jiří:Brezovský, Jan",PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY 12: e100496,1,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Smarcal1-Mediated Fork Reversal Triggers Mre11-Dependent Degradation of Nascent DNA in the Absence of Brca2 and Stable Rad51 Nucleofilaments,"Brca2 deficiency causes Mre11-dependent degradation of nascent DNA at stalled forks, leading to cell lethality. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, we isolated Xenopus laevis Brca2. We demonstrated that Brca2 protein prevents single-stranded DNA gap accumulation at replication fork junctions and behind them by promoting Rad51 binding to replicating DNA. Without Brca2, forks with persistent gaps are converted by Smarcal1 into reversed forks, triggering extensive Mre11-dependent nascent DNA degradation. Stable Rad51 nucleofilaments, but not RPA or Rad51(T131P) mutant proteins, directly prevent Mre11-dependent DNA degradation. Mre11 inhibition instead promotes reversed fork accumulation in the absence of Brca2. Rad51 directly interacts with the Pol alpha N-terminal domain, promoting Pol alpha and delta binding to stalled replication forks. This interaction likely promotes replication fork restart and gap avoidance. These results indicate that Brca2 and Rad51 prevent formation of abnormal DNA replication intermediates, whose processing by Smarcal1 and Mre11 predisposes to genome instability.",10608.0,"Kolinjivadi, A.M.:Sannino, V.:De Antoni, A.:Movsesjan, Karina:Kilkenny, M.:Techer, H.:Baldi, G.:Shen, R.:Ciccia, A.:Pellegrini, L.:Krejčí, Lumír:Costanzo, V.",Molecular Cell,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Measurement of preheat due to nonlocal electron transport in warm dense matter,This Letter presents a novel approach to study electron transport in warm dense matter. It also includes the first x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurement from low-density CH foams compressed by a strong laser-driven shock at the OMEGA laser facility. The XRTS measurement is combined with velocity interferometry (VISAR) and optical pyrometry (SOP) providing a robust measurement of thermodynamic conditions in the shock. Evidence of significant preheat contributing to elevated temperatures reaching 17.5-35 eV in shocked CH foam is measured by XRTS. These measurements are complemented by abnormally high shock velocities observed by VISAR and early emission seen by SOP. These results are compared to radiation hydrodynamics simulations that include first-principles treatment of nonlocal electron transport in warm dense matter with excellent agreement. Additional simulations confirm that the x-ray contribution to this preheat is negligible.,10305.0,"Falk, Kateřina:Holec, M.:Fontes, C.J.:Fryer, C.L.:Greeff, C.W.:Johns, H.M.:Montgomery, D.

On-line condition measurement was used for controlling the disintegration process withoutncompromising the structural integrity of neighbouring materials. With a flow rate of 0.54 l/min, a maximumndisintegration depth of 1.3 mm and material removal of 0.4 mm3 was obtained using physiologicalnsaline and 1.1 mmand 0.2 mm3 for water.

Bioaccumulation of psychoactive pharmaceuticals in fish in an effluent dominated stream,"The treated effluent from sewage treatment plants (STP) is a major source of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that enter the aquatic environment. Bioaccumulation of 11 selected psychoactive pharmaceuticals (citalopram, clomipramine, haloperidol, hydroxyzine, levomepromazine, mianserin, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, tramadol and venlafaxine) was examined in Zivny Stream (tributary of the Blanice River, the Czech Republic), which is a small stream highly affected by effluent from the Prachatice STP. Six of the 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in grab water samples and in passive samplers. All pharmaceuticals were found in fish exposed to the stream for a defined time. The organs with highest presence of the selected pharmaceuticals were the liver and kidney, whereas only one pharmaceutical (sertraline) was detected in the brain of exposed fish. Fish plasma and muscle samples were not adequate in revealing exposure because the number of hits was much lower than that in the liver or kidney. Using the criterion of a bioaccumulation factor (BAF) &gt,= 500, citalopram, mianserin, mirtazapine and sertraline could be classified as potential bioaccumulative compounds.

Stationary solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes system driven by stochastic forces,"We study the long-time behavior of solutions to a stochastically driven Navier-Stokes system describing the motion of a compressible viscous fluid driven by a temporal multiplicative white noise perturbation. The existence of stationary solutions is established in the framework of Lebesgue-Sobolev spaces pertinent to the class of weak martingale solutions. The methods are based on new global-in-time estimates and a combination of deterministic and stochastic compactness arguments. An essential tool in order to obtain the global-in-time estimate is the stationarity of solutions on each approximation level, which provides a certain regularizing effect. In contrast with the deterministic case, where related results were obtained only under rather restrictive constitutive assumptions for the pressure, the stochastic case is tractable in the full range of constitutive relations allowed by the available existence theory, due to the underlying martingale structure of the noise.",10101.0,"Breit, Dominic:Feireisl, Eduard:Hofmanova, Martina:Maslowski, Bohdan",Probability Theory and Related Fields,1,medium,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Localization, Grasping, and Transportation of Magnetic Objects by a team of MAVs in Challenging Desert like Environments","Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles have the potential to assist in real life tasks involving grasping and transportation, but not before solving several difficult research challenges. In this work, we address the design, control, estimation, and planning problems for cooperative localization, grasping, and transportation of objects in challenging outdoor scenarios. We demonstrate an autonomous team of MAVs able to plan safe trajectories for manipulation of ferrous objects, while guaranteeing inter-robot collision avoidance and automatically creating a map of the objects in the environment. Our solution is predominantly distributed, allowing the team to pick and transport ferrous disks to a final destination without collisions. This result is achieved using a new magnetic gripper with a novel feedback approach, enabling the detection of successful grasping.

SLAM++-A Highly Efficient and Temporally Scalable Incremental SLAM Framework,"The most common way to deal with the uncertainty present in noisy sensorial perception and action is to model the problem with a probabilistic framework. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a well-known estimation method used in many robotic and computer vision applications. Under Gaussian assumption, the MLE converts to a nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem.  Efficient solutions to NLS exist and they are based on iteratively solving sparse linear systems until convergence. In general, the existing solutions provide only an estimation of the mean state vector, the resulting covariance being computationally too expensive to recover. Nevertheless, in many simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) applications, knowing only the mean vector is not enough. Data association, obtaining reduced state representations, active decisions and next best view are only a few of the applications that require fast state covariance recovery. Furthermore, computer vision and robotic applications are in general performed online. In this case, the state is updated and recomputed every step and its size is continuously growing, therefore, the estimation process may become highly computationally demanding.  This paper introduces a general framework for incremental MLE called SLAM++, which fully benefits from the incremental nature of the online applications, and provides efficient estimation of both the mean and the covariance of the estimate. Based on that, we propose a strategy for maintaining a sparse and scalable state representation for large scale mapping. SLAM++ differs from existing implementations by performing all the matrix operations by blocks. This led to extremely fast matrix manipulation and arithmetic operations used in NLS. Even though this paper tests SLAM++ efficiency on SLAM problems, its applicability remains general.",10201.0,"Ila, Viorela Simona:Polok, Lukáš:Šolony, Marek:Svoboda, Pavel",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH,1,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do Borders Really Slash Trade? A Meta-Analysis,"National borders reduce trade, but most estimates of the border effect seem puzzlingly large. We show that major methodological innovations of the last decade combine to shrink the border effect to a one-third reduction in international trade flows worldwide. For the computation we collect 1,271 estimates of the border effect reported in 61 studies, codify 32 aspects of study design that may influence the estimates, and use Bayesian model averaging to take into account model uncertainty in meta-analysis. Our results suggest that methods systematically affect the estimated border effects. Especially important is the level of aggregation, measurement of internal and external distance, control for multilateral resistance, and treatment of zero trade flows. We also find that the magnitude of the border effect is associated with country characteristics, such as size and income.",50201.0,"Havránek, Tomáš:Iršová, Zuzana",IMF Economic Review,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Fracture in random quasibrittle media: I. Discrete mesoscale simulations of load capacity and fracture process zone,"Numerical simulations of concrete fracture performed with a probabilistic mesoscale discrete model are presented. The model represents a substantial part of material randomness by assigning random locations to the largest aggregates. The remaining part of randomness is introduced by causing material parameters to fluctuate randomly via a homogeneous random field. An extensive numerical study performed with the model considers prisms loaded in uniaxial tension with both fixed and rotating platens, and also beams with and without a notch loaded in three point bending. The results show the nontrivial effect of (i) autocorrelation length and (ii) variance of the random field on the fracture behavior of the model. Statistics of the peak load are presented as well as the size and shape of the fracture process zone at the moment when the maximum load is attained. Local averaging within the fracture process zone and weakest-link are identified as underlying mechanisms explaining the reported results.

Bacterial resistance to silver nanoparticles and how to overcome it,"Silver nanoparticles have already been successfully applied in various biomedical and antimicrobial technologies and products used in everyday life. Although bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been extensively discussed in the literature, the possible development of resistance to silver nanoparticles has not been fully explored. We report that the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli 013, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCM 3955 and E. coli CCM 3954 can develop resistance to silver nanoparticles after repeated exposure. The resistance stems from the production of the adhesive flagellum protein flagellin, which triggers the aggregation of the nanoparticles. This resistance evolves without any genetic changes, only phenotypic change is needed to reduce the nanoparticles&apos, colloidal stability and thus eliminate their antibacterial activity. The resistance mechanism cannot be overcome by additional stabilization of silver nanoparticles using surfactants or polymers.

Targeting of BCL2 Family Proteins with ABT-199 and Homoharringtonine Reveals BCL2-and MCL1-Dependent Subgroups of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma,"Purpose: To investigate the roles of BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL in the survival of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Experimental designs: Immunohistochemical analysis of 105 primary DLBCL samples, and Western blot analysis of 18 DLBCL cell lines for the expression of BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL. Pharmacologic targeting of BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL with ABT-199, homoharringtonine (HHT), and ABT-737. Analysis of DLBCL clones with manipulated expressions of BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL. Immunoprecipitation of MCL1 complexes in selected DLBCL cell lines. Experimental therapy aimed at inhibition of BCL2 and MCL1 using ABT-199 and HHT, single agent, or in combination, in vitro and in vivo on primary cell-based murine xenograft models of DLBCL. Results: By the pharmacologic targeting of BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL, we demonstrated that DLBCL can be divided into BCL2-dependent and MCL1-dependent subgroups with a less pronounced role left for BCL-XL. Derived DLBCL clones with manipulated expressions of BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL, as well as the immunoprecipitation experiments, which analyzed MCL1 protein complexes, confirmed these findings at the molecular level. We demonstrated that concurrent inhibition of BCL2 and MCL1 with ABT-199 and HHT induced significant synthetic lethality in most BCL2-expressing DLBCL cell lines. The marked cytotoxic synergy between ABT-199 and HHT was also confirmed in vivo using primary cell-based murine xenograft models of DLBCL.

The Strasbourg Court Meets Abusive Constitutionalism: Baka v. Hungary and the Rule of Law,"The rise of abusive constitutionalism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has hit the domestic judiciaries particularly hard. Viktor Orbán expanded the size of the Constitutional Court and then packed it, made sure that he can install a new president of the Constitutional Court, ousted the Supreme Court president through a constitutional amendment, disempowered the existing judicial council and created the new institution with power over ordinary judicial appointments. Jaroslav Kaczyński followed the same playbook in Poland. While most scholars have focused primarily on effects of abusive constitutionalism upon the constitutional courts, we argue that the keys to the long-term control of the judiciary are presidents of ordinary courts and judicial councils . The dismissal of the Hungarian Supreme Court President is a perfect example of this logic—by this move Orbán got rid of the most important court president in the country, the head of the Hungarian judicial council and his most vocal critic. Yet, András Baka lodged an application to the ECtHR and won. This article analyses the Grand Chamber judgment in Baka v. Hungary, its implication for the rule of law, and the limits of what the ECtHR can achieve against abusive constitutionalism. It concludes that the Grand Chamber failed on all key fronts. It overlooked the main structural problem behind Mr. Baka’s dismissal (the broad powers of court presidents in CEE), it has blurred the Convention’s understanding of the concept of the rule of law, and it failed in delivering a persuasive judgment firmly based on the existing ECtHR’s case law.",50501.0,"Kosař, David:Šipulová, Katarína",Hague Journal on the Rule of Law,1,high,high,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In all cases, Hispania, or rather the Visigoth Kingdom, plays the role of an ?unconquered? foreign area or an area under Frank dominance. The function of such an approach and the creation of tradition is clear: to affirm that the Franks were the chosen ones in God?s Plan of Salvation and to affirm their superiority.

Affine Invariants of Vector Fields,"Vector fields are a special kind of multidimensional data, which are in a certain sense similar to digital color images, but are distinct from them in several aspects. In each pixel, the field is assigned to a vector that shows the direction and the magnitude of the quantity, which has been measured. To detect the patterns of interest in the field, special matching methods must be developed. In this paper, we propose a method for the description and matching of vector field patterns under an unknown affine transformation of the field. Unlike digital images, transformations of vector fields act not only on the spatial coordinates but also on the field values, which makes the detection different from the image case. To measure the similarity between the template and the field patch, we propose original invariants with respect to total affine transformation. They are designed from the vector field moments.

Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is an evolutionarily conserved determinant of chordate dorsal organizer,"Deciphering the mechanisms of axis formation in amphioxus is a key step to understanding the evolution of chordate body plan. The current view is that Nodal signaling is the only factor promoting the dorsal axis specification in the amphioxus, whereas Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays no role in this process. Here, we re-examined the role of Wnt/beta catenin signaling in the dorsal/ventral patterning of amphioxus embryo. We demonstrated that the spatial activity of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is located in presumptive dorsal cells from cleavage to gastrula stage, and provided functional evidence that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is necessary for the specification of dorsal cell fate in a stage-dependent manner. Microinjection of Wnt8 and Wnt11 mRNA induced ectopic dorsal axis in neurulae and larvae. Finally, we demonstrated that Nodal and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cooperate to promote the dorsal-specific gene expression in amphioxus gastrula.

BCR-ABL1 mediated miR-150 downregulation through MYC contributed to myeloid differentiation block and drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia,"The fusion oncoprotein BCR-ABL1 exhibits aberrant tyrosine kinase activity and has been proposed to deregulate signaling networks involving both transcription factors and non-coding microRNAs that result in chronic myeloid leukemia. Previously, microRNA expression profiling showed deregulated expression of miR-150 and miR-155 in chronic myeloid leukemia. In this study, we placed these findings into the broader context of the MYC/miR-150/MYB/miR-155/PU.1 oncogenic network. We propose that upregulated MYC and miR-155 in CD34+ leukemic stem and progenitor cells in concert with BCR-ABL1 impair the molecular mechanisms of myeloid differentiation associated with low miR-150 and PU.1 levels. We revealed that MYC directly occupied the -11.7 kb and -0.35 kb regulatory regions in the MIR150 gene.

Long-term exposure to very low doses of bisphenol S affects female reproduction,"Bisphenols belong to the endocrine disruptors, affecting reproduction even in extremely low doses. Bisphenol S (BPS) has become widely used as a substitute for the earlier-used bisphenol A, however, its harmlessness is questionable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BPS on folliculogenesis and oocyte quality after in vivo exposure to low doses of BPS. Four-week-old ICR females (n=16 in each experimental group) were exposed to vehicle control (VC), BPS1 (0.001 ng BPS.g/bw/day), BPS2 (0.1 ng.g/bw/day), BPS3 (10 ng.g/bw/day) and BPS4 (100 ng.g/bw/day) for 4 weeks. Ovaries were subjected to stereology and nano liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Simultaneously, metaphase II oocytes were obtained after pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin and human chorionic gonadotrophin administration, followed by immunostaining. In particular, mating and two-cell embryo flushing were performed. We observed that BPS decreases the amount of ovarian follicles and BPS2 (0.1 ng.g/bw/day) affects the volume of antral follicles. Accordingly, ovarian proteome is affected after BPS2 treatment. While BPS2 dosing results mainly in cytoskeletal damage in matured oocytes, the effects of BPS3 and BPS4 seem to be due instead to epigenetic alterations in oocytes. Arguably, these changes lead to observed affection of in vivo fertilization rate after BPS3 and BPS4 treatment. BPS significantly affects female reproduction astoundingly in extremely low doses. These findings underline the necessity to assess the risk of ongoing BPS exposure for public health.",10604.0,"Žalmanová, Tereza:Petr, Jaroslav",Reproduction,1,high,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Chlorophyll f synthesis by a super-rogue photosystem II complex,"Certain cyanobacteria synthesize chlorophyll molecules (Chl d and Chl f) that absorb in the far-red region of the solar spectrum, thereby extending the spectral range of photosynthetically active radiation(1,2). The synthesis and introduction of these far-red chlorophylls into the photosynthetic apparatus of plants might improve the efficiency of oxygenic photosynthesis, especially in far-red enriched environments, such as in the lower regions of the canopy(3). Production of Chl f requires the ChlF subunit, also known as PsbA4 (ref. (4)) or super-rogue D1 (ref. (5)), a paralogue of the D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) which, together with D2, bind cofactors involved in the light-driven oxidation of water. Current ideas suggest that ChlF oxidizes Chl a to Chl f in a homodimeric ChlF reaction centre (RC) complex and represents a missing link in the evolution of the heterodimeric D1/D2 RC of PSII (refs. (4,6)). However, unambiguous biochemical support for this proposal is lacking. Here, we show that ChlF can substitute for D1 to form modified PSII complexes capable of producing Chl f. Remarkably, mutation of just two residues in D1 converts oxygen-evolving PSII into a Chl f synthase. Overall, we have identified a new class of PSII complex, which we term 'super-rogue' PSII, with an unexpected role in pigment biosynthesis rather than water oxidation.nThe cyanobacterial chlorophyll, Chl f, absorbs far-red light. Mutation of two residues in a subunit of photosystem II converts it to a Chl f synthase. This 'super-rogue' photosystem might improve photosynthetic efficiency in low light.",10606.0,"Trinugroho, J.P.:Bečková, Martina:Shao, S.X.:Yu, J.F.:Zhao, Z.Y.:Murray, J.

Mycobacterial HelD is a nucleic acids-clearing factor for RNA polymerase,"RNA synthesis is central to life, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) depends on accessory factors for recovery from stalled states and adaptation to environmental changes. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which a helicase-like factor HelD recycles RNAP. We report a cryo-EM structure of a complex between the Mycobacterium smegmatis RNAP and HelD. The crescent-shaped HelD simultaneously penetrates deep into two RNAP channels that are responsible for nucleic acids binding and substrate delivery to the active site, thereby locking RNAP in an inactive state. We show that HelD prevents non-specific interactions between RNAP and DNA and dissociates stalled transcription elongation complexes. The liberated RNAP can either stay dormant, sequestered by HelD, or upon HelD release, restart transcription. Our results provide insights into the architecture and regulation of the highly medically-relevant mycobacterial transcription machinery and define HelD as a clearing factor that releases RNAP from nonfunctional complexes with nucleic acids.",10610.0,"Kouba, T.:Koval, Tomáš:Sudzinová, Petra:Pospíšil, Jiří:Brezovská, Barbora:Hnilicová, Jarmila:Šanderová, Hana:Janoušková, Martina:Šiková, Michaela:Halada, Petr:Sýkora, Michal:Barvík, I.:Nováček, J.:Trundová, Mária:Dušková, Jarmila:Skálová, Tereza:Chon, U.

Maternal auxin supply contributes to early embryo patterning in Arabidopsis,"The angiosperm seed is composed of three genetically distinct tissues: the diploid embryo that originates from the fertilized egg cell, the triploid endosperm that is produced from the fertilized central cell, and the maternal sporophytic integuments that develop into the seed coat(1). At the onset of embryo development in Arabidopsis thaliana, the zygote divides asymmetrically, producing a small apical embryonic cell and a larger basal cell that connects the embryo to the maternal tissue(2). The coordinated and synchronous development of the embryo and the surrounding integuments, and the alignment of their growth axes, suggest communication between maternal tissues and the embryo. In contrast to animals, however, where a network of maternal factors that direct embryo patterning have been identified(3,4), only a few maternal mutations have been described to affect embryo development in plants(5-7). Early embryo patterning in Arabidopsis requires accumulation of the phytohormone auxin in the apical cell by directed transport from the suspensors(8-10). However, the origin of this auxin has remained obscure. Here we investigate the source of auxin for early embryogenesis and provide evidence that the mother plant coordinates seed development by supplying auxin to the early embryo from the integuments of the ovule. We show that auxin response increases in ovules after fertilization, due to upregulated auxin biosynthesis in the integuments, and this maternally produced auxin is required for correct embryo development.",10604.0,"Robert Boisivon, Helene:Park, Chulmin:Guiterrez, Carla Loreto:Barbara Wójcikowska, externista:Pencik, Ales:Novak, Ondrej:Chen, Junyi:Grunewald, Wim:Dresselhaus, Thomas:Friml, Jiří:Laux, Thomas",NATURE PLANTS,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Grain-Resolved Analysis of Localized Deformation in Nickel-Titanium Wire under Tensile Load,The stress-induced martensitic transformation in tensioned nickel-titanium shape-memory alloys proceeds by propagation of macroscopic fronts of localized deformation. We used three-dimensional synchrotron x-ray diffraction to image at micrometer-scale resolution the grain-resolved elastic strains and stresses in austenite around one such front in a prestrained nickel-titanium wire. We found that the local stresses in austenite grains are modified ahead of the nose cone-shaped buried interface where the martensitic transformation begins. Elevated shear stresses at the cone interface explain why the martensitic transformation proceeds in a localized manner. We established the crossover from stresses in individual grains to a continuum macroscopic internal stress field in the wire and rationalized the experimentally observed internal stress field and the topology of the macroscopic front by means of finite element simulations of the localized deformation.,0.0,"Sedmák, Pavel:Pilch, J.:Heller, L.:Kopecek, J.",SCIENCE,1,medium,high,0,0,high,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"RET, NTRK, ALK, BRAF, and MET fusions in a large cohort of pediatric papillary thyroid carcinomas","Pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a rare malignancy, but with increasing incidence. Pediatric PTCs have distinct clinical and pathological features and even the molecular profile differs from adult PTCs. Somatic point mutations in pediatric PTCs have been previously described and studied, but complex information about fusion genes is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify different fusion genes in a large cohort of pediatric PTCs and to correlate them with clinical and pathological data of patients. Methods:The cohort consisted of 93 pediatric PTC patients (6-20 years old). DNA and RNA were extracted from fresh frozen tissue samples, followed by DNA and RNA-targeted next-generation sequencing analyses. Fusion gene-positive samples were verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results:A genetic alteration was found in 72/93 (77.4%) pediatric PTC cases. In 52/93 (55.9%) pediatric PTC patients, a fusion gene was detected. Twenty different types ofRET,NTRK3,ALK,NTRK1,BRAF, andMETfusions were found, of which five novel,TPR/RET,IKBKG/RET,BBIP1/RET,OPTN/BRAF, andEML4/MET, rearrangements were identified and aCUL1/BRAFrearrangement that has not been previously described in thyroid cancer. Fusion gene-positive PTCs were significantly associated with the mixture of classical and follicular variants of PTC, extrathyroidal extension, higher T classification, lymph node and distant metastases, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, and frequent occurrence of psammoma bodies compared with fusion gene-negative PTCs. Fusion-positive patients also received more doses of radioiodine therapy. The most common fusion genes were theRETfusions, followed byNTRK3fusions.RETfusions were associated with more frequent lymph node and distant metastases and psammoma bodies, andNTRK3fusions were associated with the follicular variant of PTC.

Short- and long-term outcomes of alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in patients with mild left ventricular hypertrophy: a propensity score matching analysis,"AIMS: Based on European guidelines, alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is indicated only in patients with interventricular septum (IVS) thickness &gt,16 mm. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes in ASA patients with mild hypertrophy (IVS &lt,= 16 mm). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 1505 consecutive ASA patients and used propensity score to match 172 pairs (344 patients) in groups IVS &lt,= 16 mm or IVS &gt, 16 mm. There was no occurrence of post-ASA ventriculoseptal defect in the whole cohort (n = 1505). Matched patients had 30-day mortality rate 0% in IVS &lt,= 16 mm group and 0.6% in IVS &gt, 16 mm group (P = 1). Patients in IVS &lt,= 16 mm group had more ASA-attributable early complications (16% vs. 9%, P = 0.049), which was driven by higher need for pacemaker implantation (13% vs. 8%, P = 0.22). The mean follow-up was 5.4 +- 4.3 years and the annual all-cause mortality rate was 1.8 and 3.2 deaths per 100-patient-years in IVS &lt,= 16 group and IVS &gt, 16 group, respectively (log-rank test P = 0.04). There were no differences in symptom relief and left ventricular (LV) gradient reduction. Patients with IVS &lt,= 16 mm had less repeated septal reduction procedures (log-rank test P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Selected patients with HOCM and mild hypertrophy (IVS &lt,= 16 mm) had more early post-ASA complications driven by need for pacemaker implantation, but their long-term survival is better than in patients with IVS &gt,16 mm. While relief of symptoms and LV obstruction reduction is similar in both groups, a need for repeat septal reduction is higher in patients with IVS &gt, 16 mm.

Left Atrial Appendage Closure Versus Direct Oral Anticoagulants in High-Risk Patients With Atrial Fibrillation,"BACKGROUND Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is noninferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for preventing atrial fibrillation (AF)-related stroke. However, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have an improved safety profile over VKAs, and their effect on cardiovascular and neurological outcomes relative to LAAC is unknown. OBJECTIVES This study sought to compare DOACs with LAAC in high-risk patients with AF. METHODS Left Atrial Appendage Closure vs. Novel Anticoagulation Agents in Atrial Fibrillation (PRAGUE-17) was a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing LAAC with DOACs. Patients were eligible to be enrolled if they had nonvalvular AF, were indicated for oral anticoagulation (OAC), and had a history of bleeding requiring intervention or hospitalization, a history of a cardioembolic event while taking an OAC, and/or a CHA2DS2-VASc of $3 and HAS-BLED of &gt,2. Patients were randomized to receive LAAC or DOAC. The primary composite outcome was stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, cardiovascular death, major or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding, or procedure-/devicerelated complications. The primary analysis was by modified intention to treat. RESULTS A high-risk patient cohort (CHA2DS2-VASc: 4.7 1.5) was randomized to receive LAAC (n 1/4 201) or DOAC (n1/4201). LAACwas successful in 181 of 201 (90.0%) patients. In the DOAC group, apixabanwas most frequently used (192 of 201, 95.5%). At a median 19.9 months of follow-up, the annual rates of the primary outcome were 10.99% with LAAC and 13.42%with DOAC (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR]: 0.84, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 0.53 to 1.31, p 1/4 0.44, p 1/4 0.004 for noninferiority). There were no differences between groups for the components of the composite endpoint: all-stroke/TIA (sHR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.40 to 2.51), clinically significant bleeding (sHR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.44 to 1.52), and cardiovascular death (sHR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.62). Major LAAC-related complications occurred in 9 (4.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS Among patients at high risk for stroke and increased risk of bleeding, LAAC was noninferior to DOAC in preventing major AF-related cardiovascular, neurological, and bleeding events.

Spinal subpial delivery of AAV9 enables widespread gene silencing and blocks motoneuron degeneration in ALS,"Gene silencing with virally delivered shRNA represents a promising approach for treatment of inherited neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study we develop a subpial technique, which we show in adult animals successfully delivers adeno-associated virus (AAV) throughout the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord, as well as brain motor centers. One-time injection at cervical and lumbar levels just before disease onset in mice expressing a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-causing mutant SOD1 produces long-term suppression of motoneuron disease, including near-complete preservation of spinal alpha-motoneurons and muscle innervation. Treatment after disease onset potently blocks progression of disease and further alpha-motoneuron degeneration. A single subpial AAV9 injection in adult pigs or non-human primates using a newly designed device produces homogeneous delivery throughout the cervical spinal cord white and gray matter and brain motor centers. Thus, spinal subpial delivery in adult animals is highly effective for AAV-mediated gene delivery throughout the spinal cord and supraspinal motor centers.",30402.0,"Bravo-Hernandez, M.:Tadokoro, T.:Navarro, M.:Platoshyn, O.:Kobayashi, Y.:Maršala, S.:Miyanohara, A.:Juhás, Štefan:Juhásová, Jana:Skalníková, Helena:Tomori, Z.:Vanický, I.:Studenovská, Hana:Proks, Vladimír:Chen, P.:Govea-Perez, N.:Ditsworth, D.:Ciacci, J.

Health Hazards Associated with Arthropod Infestation of Stored Products,"Insects and mites are common inhabitants and accidental invaders of food, including durable commodities, and their presence can have both direct and indirect effects on human health. The most common direct effect is contamination of food with arthropod fragments and related contaminants, which may be allergenic or even carcinogenic. The most important indirect effect is that their presence can change the storage microenvironment, making durable products suitable for the rapid development of fungi and other microorganisms. Some of these fungi can produce toxins (e.g., aflatoxins) that endanger human health. Insects may actively or passively contribute to the spread of microorganisms, increasing product contamination, and they may host bacteria that have developed antibiotic resistance, contributing to their spread in food. Several species also may host, attract, or transmit tapeworms, predators, or parasitoids that may affect health.

Case-Control Study: Smoking History Affects the Production of Tumor Antigen-Specific Antibodies NY-ESO-1 in Patients with Lung Cancer in Comparison with Cancer Disease-Free Group,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, therefore, understanding the biological or clinical role of tumor-associated antigens and auto antibodies is of eminent interest for designing antitumor immunotherapeutic strategies. Methods: Here we prospectively analyzed the serum frequencies of New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1), human epidermal growth factor 2/neu, and melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4) antibodies and expression of the corresponding antigens in tumors of 121 patients with NSCLC undergoing an operation without prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy and compared them with those in 57 control age-matched patients with no history of a malignant disease. Results: We found that only antibodies specific for NY-ESO-1 (19.8% [n = 24 of 121]) were significantly increased in the group of patients with NSCLC compared with in the controls. NY-ESO-1 seropositivity was significantly positively associated with an active smoking history in patients with NSCLC but not in smokers from the control group. In tumors, the frequency of NY-ESO-1 mRNA expression was 6.3% (in four of 64 patients), the frequency of human epidermal growth factor 2/neu (HER 2/neu) expression was 11.9% (five of 42), and the frequency of MAGE-A4 expression was 35.1% (20 of 57). MAGE-A4 expression in tumors correlated with smoking status and male sex in patients with NSCLC. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma displayed higher expression of NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A4 in tumors than did patients with adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, 94.7% of nonsmoking patients in our study had adenocarcinoma (of whom 73.7% were women). Conclusion: These results confirm the reported high immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 and suggest that a smoking induced chronic inflammatory state might potentiate the development of NY-ESO-1-specific immune responses. Moreover, smoking might contribute to the expression of other cancer/testis antigens such as MAGE-A4 at early stages of NSCLC development.",30102.0,"Myšíková, Dagmar:Adkins, Irena:Hradilová, Naďa:Palata, Ondřej:Šimonek, Jan:Pozniak, Jiří:Kolařík, Jan:Fialová, Anna:Špíšek, Radek:Lischke, Robert",Journal of Thoracic Oncology,1,low,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
RAD51-dependent recruitment of TERRA lncRNA to telomeres through R-loops,"Telomeres- repeated, noncoding nucleotide motifs and associated proteins that are found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes—mediate genome stability and determine cellular lifespan. Telomeric-repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) is a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are transcribed from chromosome ends, these RNAs in turn regulate telomeric chromatin structure and telomere maintenance through the telomere-extending enzyme telomerase and homology-directed DNA repair. The mechanisms by which TERRA is recruited to chromosome ends remain poorly defined. Here we develop a reporter system with which to dissect the underlying mechanisms, and show that the UUAGGG repeats of TERRA are both necessary and sufficient to target TERRA to chromosome ends. TERRA preferentially associates with short telomeres through the formation of telomeric DNA–RNA hybrid (R-loop) structures that can form in trans. Telomere association and R-loop formation trigger telomere fragility and are promoted by the recombinase RAD51 and its interacting partner BRCA2, but counteracted by the RNA-surveillance factors RNaseH1 and TRF1. RAD51 physically interacts with TERRA and catalyses R-loop formation with TERRA in vitro, suggesting a direct involvement of this DNA recombinase in the recruitment of TERRA by strand invasion. Together, our findings reveal a RAD51-dependent pathway that governs TERRA-mediated R-loop formation after transcription, providing a mechanism for the recruitment of lncRNAs to new loci in trans.",10603.0,"Feretzaki, Marianna:Pospíšilová, Michaela:Valador Fernandes, Rita:Lunardi, Thomas:Krejčí, Lumír:Lingner, Joachim",Nature,1,high,high,0,1,high,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0

Shedding the content: semantics of teaching burdened by didactic formalisms,"The paper argues that what is left behind in the current era of accountability is the educational content. The authors present shedding the content as the great challenge of teaching and learning in today’s schools. They turn to the tradition of Bildung and outline the theoretical background for the content-focused approach to (research on) teaching and learning. Their approach is based on analyses of authentic (real-life) teaching and learning situations. The paper highlights how didactic case studies can be used to generalize the findings across individual cases. Within the multiple case studies, 44 didactic case studies were reanalysed to identify didactic formalisms, i.e. problems in the semantic and logical structure of educational content, which corrupt the quality of instruction. Two specific types of didactic formalism are described in detail, stolen cognition and concealed cognition. Stolen cognition prevents cognitive activation of students when the teacher over-reduces the space allowed for the students’ cognitive work with the content, concealed cognition are instances of purposeless cognitive activation of students due to their being disconnected from the content.",50301.0,"Janík, Tomáš:Slavík, Jan:Najvar, Petr:Janíková, Marcela",Journal of Curriculum Studies,1,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase coordinates meiotic DNA double-strand break induction and repair independent of its catalytic activity,"Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a reversible post-translational modification synthetized by ADP-ribose transferases and removed by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), which plays important roles in DNA damage repair. While well-studied in somatic tissues, much less is known about poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the germline, where DNA double-strand breaks are introduced by a regulated program and repaired by crossover recombination to establish a tether between homologous chromosomes. The interaction between the parental chromosomes is facilitated by meiotic specific adaptation of the chromosome axes and cohesins, and reinforced by the synaptonemal complex. Here, we uncover an unexpected role for PARG in coordinating the induction of meiotic DNA breaks and their homologous recombination-mediated repair in Caenorhabditis elegans. PARG-1/PARG interacts with both axial and central elements of the synaptonemal complex, REC-8/Rec8 and the MRN/X complex. PARG-1 shapes the recombination landscape and reinforces the tightly regulated control of crossover numbers without requiring its catalytic activity. We unravel roles in regulating meiosis, beyond its enzymatic activity in poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is involved in different cellular processes including DNA repair.

Reactivation of Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase-Driven Pyrimidine Biosynthesis Restores Tumor Growth of Respiration-Deficient Cancer Cells,"Cancer cells without mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) do not form tumors unless they reconstitute oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by mitochondria acquired from host stroma. To understand why functional respiration is crucial for tumorigenesis, we used time-resolved analysis of tumor formation by mtDNA-depleted cells and genetic manipulations of OXPHOS. We show that pyrimidine biosynthesis dependent on respiration-linked dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is required to overcome cell-cycle arrest, while mitochondrial ATP generation is dispensable for tumorigenesis. Latent DHODH in mtDNA-deficient cells is fully activated with restoration of complex III/IV activity and coenzyme Q redox-cycling after mitochondrial transfer, or by introduction of an alternative oxidase. Further, deletion of DHODH interferes with tumor formation in cells with fully functional OXPHOS, while disruption of mitochondrial ATP synthase has little effect. Our results show that DHODH-driven pyrimidine biosynthesis is an essential pathway linking respiration to tumorigenesis, pointing to inhibitors of DHODH as potential anti-cancer agents.",10601.0,"Bajziková, Martina:Kovářová, Jaromíra:Coelho, Ana R.:Boukalová, Štěpána:Oh, S.:Rohlenová, Kateřina:Švec, David:Hubáčková, Soňa:Endaya, B.:Judasová, Kateřina:Bezawork-Geleta, A.:Klučková, Katarína:Chatre, L.:Zobalová, Renata:Nováková, Anna:Váňová, Kateřina:Ezrová, Zuzana:Maghzal, G.

Informal practices and the street-level construction of migrant deportability: Chechen refugees and local authorities in Polish accommodation centres for asylum seekers,"In a world of unprecedented mobility, an increasing number of migrants are confronted with policies that challenge their belonging and produce subordinate migrant inclusion. This article explores how the deportation regime saturated daily life in accommodation centres for asylum seekers in Eastern Poland, which acted as spaces of deportability that facilitated the deterritorialisation of European political space. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among Chechen refugees and local authorities, I argue that the street-level construction of deportability depends on an exchange between formal and informal practices and policies. Ethnographic data indicate that in the Polish centres, the deportation regime took both bureaucratic and nonbureaucratic forms. As street-level bureaucrats carried out their work duties in a way that reduced the scope of their power, the deportation regime relied on refugees to reproduce its disciplinary aspect.",50404.0,"Šípoš, Michal",Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,1,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
ATP synthase from trypanosoma brucei has an elaborated canonical f<inf>1</inf>-domain and conventional catalytic sites,"The structures and functions of the components of ATP synthases, especially those subunits involved directly in the catalytic formation of ATP, are widely conserved in metazoans, fungi, eubacteria, and plant chloroplasts. On the basis of a map at 32.5-Å resolution determined in situ in the mitochondria of Trypanosoma brucei by electron cryotomography, it has been proposed that the ATP synthase in this species has a noncanonical structure and different catalytic sites in which the catalytically essential arginine finger is provided not by the α-subunit adjacent to the catalytic nucleotide-binding site as in all species investigated to date, but rather by a protein, p18, found only in the euglenozoa. A crystal structure at 3.2-Å resolution of the catalytic domain of the same enzyme demonstrates that this proposal is incorrect. In many respects, the structure is similar to the structures of F1- ATPases determined previously. The α3β3-spherical portion of the catalytic domain in which the three catalytic sites are found, plus the central stalk, are highly conserved, and the arginine finger is provided conventionally by the α-subunits adjacent to each of the three catalytic sites found in the β-subunits. Thus, the enzyme has a conventional catalytic mechanism. The structure differs from previous described structures by the presence of a p18 subunit, identified only in the euglenozoa, associated with the external surface of each of the three α-subunits, thereby elaborating the F1-domain. Subunit p18 is a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with three PPRs and appears to have no function in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.",30405.0,"Montgomery, M.

Palearctic bat communities tolerate similar fungal loads of Pseudogymnoascus destructans infection as their Nearctic counterparts and histopathology indicates equal focal skin tissue invasiveness pathognomonic for WNS lesions. Fungal load positively correlates with disease intensity and it reaches highest values at intermediate latitudes. Prevalence and fungal load dynamics in Palearctic bats remained persistent and high between 2012 and 2014. Dominant haplotypes of five genes are widespread in North America, Europe and Asia, expanding the source region of white-nose syndrome to non-European hibernacula.

"Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in elective percutaneous coronary intervention (ALPHEUS): a randomised, open-label, phase 3b trial","BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-related myonecrosis is frequent and can affect the long-term prognosis of patients. To our knowledge, ticagrelor has not been evaluated in elective PCI and could reduce periprocedural ischaemic complications compared with clopidogrel, the currently recommended treatment. The aim of the ALPHEUS study was to examine if ticagrelor was superior to clopidogrel in reducing periprocedural myocardial necrosis in stable coronary patients undergoing high-risk elective PCI. METHODS: The ALPHEUS study, a phase 3b, randomised, open-label trial, was done at 49 hospitals in France and Czech Republic. Patients with stable coronary artery disease were eligible for the study if they had an indication for PCI and at least one high-risk characteristic. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter for 30 days) or clopidogrel (300-600 mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter for 30 days) by use of an interactive web response system, and stratified by centre. The primary outcome was a composite of PCI-related type 4 (a or b) myocardial infarction or major myocardial injury and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding, both of which were evaluated within 48 h of PCI (or at hospital discharge if earlier). The primary analysis was based on all events that occurred in the intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02617290. FINDINGS: Between Jan 9, 2017, and May 28, 2020, 1910 patients were randomly assigned at 49 sites, 956 to the ticagrelor group and 954 to the clopidogrel group. 15 patients were excluded from the ticagrelor group and 12 from the clopidogrel group. At 48 h, the primary outcome was observed in 334 (35%) of 941 patients in the ticagrelor group and 341 (36%) of 942 patients in the clopidogrel group (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.80-1.17, p=0.75). The primary safety outcome did not differ between the two groups, but minor bleeding events were more frequently observed with ticagrelor than clopidogrel at 30 days (105 [11%] of 941 patients in the ticagrelor group vs 71 [8%] of 942 patients in the clopidogrel group, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.12-2.11, p=0.0070).

Analysis of chronic myeloid leukaemia during deep molecular response by genomic PCR: a traffic light stratification model with impact on treatment-free remission,"This work investigated patient-specific genomic BCR-ABL1 fusions as markers of measurable residual disease (MRD) in chronic myeloid leukaemia, with a focus on relevance to treatment-free remission (TFR) after achievement of deep molecular response (DMR) on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. DNA and mRNA BCR-ABL1 measurements by qPCR were compared in 2189 samples (129 patients) and by digital PCR in 1279 sample (62 patients). A high correlation was found at levels of disease above MR4, but there was a poor correlation for samples during DMR. A combination of DNA and RNA MRD measurements resulted in a better prediction of molecular relapse-free survival (MRFS) after TKI stop (n = 17) or scheduled interruption (n = 25). At 18 months after treatment cessation, patients with stopped or interrupted TKI therapy who were DNA negative/RNA negative during DMR maintenance (green group) had an MRFS of 80% and 100%, respectively, compared with those who were DNA positive/RNA negative (MRFS = 57% and 67%, respectively, yellow group) or DNA positive/RNA positive (MRFS = 20% for both cohorts, red group).

Are the Chinese Altai “terranes” the result of juxtaposition of different crustal levels during Late Devonian and Permian orogenesis?,"The general structure of the Chinese Altai has been traditionally regarded as being formed by five tectono-stratigraphic ‘terranes’ bounded by large-scale faults. However, numerous detrital zircon studies of the Paleozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences shown that the variably metamorphosed Cambro-Ordovician sequence, known as the Habahe Group, is present at least in four ‘terranes’. It structurally represents deepest rocks unconformably covered by Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Calc-alkaline, mostly Devonian, granitoids that intruded all the terranes revealed their syn-subduction related setting. Geochemistry and isotope features of the syn-subduction granitoids have shown that they originated mainly from the melting of youthful sediments derived from an eroded Ordovician arc further north. In contrast, Permian alkaline granitoids, mostly located in the southern part of the Chinese Altai, reflect a post-subduction intraplate setting. The metamorphic evolution of the metasedimentary sequences shows an early MP-MT Barrovian event, followed by two Buchan events: LP-HT mid-Devonian (ca. 400–380 Ma) and UHT-HT Permian (ca. 300–270 Ma) cycles. The Barrovian metamorphism is linked to the formation of a regional sub-horizontal possibly Early Devonian fabric and the burial of the Cambro-Ordovician sequence. The Middle Devonian Buchan type event is related to intrusions of the syn-subduction granitoids during an extensional setting and followed by Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous NE-SW trending upright folding and crustal scale doming during a general NW-SE shortening, responsible for the exhumation of the hot lower crust. The last Permian deformation formed NW-SE trending upright folds and vertical zones of deformation related to the extrusion of migmatites, anatectic granitoids and granulite rocks, and to the intrusions of gabbros and granites along the southern border of the Chinese Altai. Finally, the Permo-Triassic cooling and thrust systems affected the whole mountain range from ca. 265 to 230 Ma. In conclusion, the Chinese Altai represents different crustal levels of the lower, middle and upper orogenic crust of a single Cambro-Ordovician accretionary wedge, heterogeneously affected by the Devonian polyphase metamorphism and deformation followed by the Permian tectono-thermal reworking event related to the collision with the Junggar arc. It is the interference of Devonian and Permian upright folding events that formed vertical boundaries surrounding the variously exhumed and eroded crustal segments. Consequently, these crustal segments should not be regarded as individual suspect terranes.",10505.0,"Aguilar Gil, Carmen:Guy, Alexandra:Schulmann, Karel:Štípská, Pavla:Broussolle, Arnaud:Sun, M.:Jiang, Yingde:Yu, Yang:Xiao, W.J.",Gondwana research,1,high,high,1,1,low,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Lenalidomide versus investigator's choice in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL-002, SPRINT): a phase 2, randomised, multicentre trial","Background: Lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug with antineoplastic and antiproliferative effects, showed activity in many single-group studies in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. The aim of this randomised study was to examine the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide versus best investigator's choice of single-agent therapy in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Methods: The MCL-002 (SPRINT) study was a randomised, phase 2 study of patients with mantle cell lymphoma aged 18 years or older at 67 clinics and academic centres in 12 countries who relapsed one to three times, had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, at least one measurable lesion to be eligible, and who were ineligible for intensive chemotherpy or stem-cell transplantation. Using a centralised interactive voice response system, we randomly assigned (2:1) patients in a permuted block size of six to receive lenalidomide (25 mg orally on days 1-21 every 28 days) until progressive disease or intolerability, or single-agent investigator's choice of either rituximab, gemcitabine, fludarabine, chlorambucil, or cytarabine. Randomisation was stratified by time from diagnosis, time from last anti-lymphoma therapy, and previous stem-cell transplantation. Individual treatment assignment between lenalidomide and investigator's choice was open label, but investigators had to register their choice of comparator drug before randomly assigning a patient. Patients who progressed on investigator's choice could cross over to lenalidomide treatment. We present the prespecified primary analysis results in the intention-to-treat population for the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to progressive disease or death, whichever occurred first.

beta-Catenin-TCF/LEF signaling promotes steady-state and emergency granulopoiesis via G-CSF receptor upregulation,"The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is mediated by interaction of beta-catenin with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors and subsequent transcription activation of Wnt-target genes. In the hematopoietic system, the function of the pathway has been mainly investigated by rather unspecific genetic manipulations of beta-catenin that yielded contradictory results. Here, we used a mouse expressing a truncated dominant negative form of the human TCF4 transcription factor (dnTCF4) that specifically abrogates beta-catenin-TCF/LEF interaction. Disruption of the beta-catenin-TCF/LEF interaction resulted in the accumulation of immature cells and reduced granulocytic differentiation. Mechanistically, dnTCF4 progenitors exhibited downregulation of the Csf3r gene, reduced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor levels, attenuation of downstream Stat3 phosphorylation after G-CSF treatment, and impaired G-CSF-mediated differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed direct binding of TCF/LEF factors to the and enhancer of CSF3R. Inhibition of compromised activation of the emergency granulopoiesis program, which requires maintenance and expansion of myeloid progenitors. Consequently, dnTCF4 mice were more susceptible to Candida albicans infection and more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil-induced granulocytic regeneration. Importantly, genetic and chemical inhibition of beta-catenin-TCF/LEF signaling in human CD34(+) cells reduced granulocytic differentiation, whereas its activation enhanced myelopoiesis. Altogether, our data indicate that the beta-catenin-TCF/LEF complex directly regulates G-CSF receptor levels, and consequently controls proper differentiation of myeloid progenitors into granulocytes in steady-state and emergency granulopoiesis. Our results uncover a role for the beta-catenin signaling pathway in fine tuning the granulocytic production, opening venues for clinical intervention that require enhanced or reduced production of neutrophils.",10608.0,"Daněk, Petr:Kardošová, Miroslava:Janečková, Lucie:Karkoulia, Eleni:Vaníčková, Karolína:Fabišik, Matěj:Lozano-Asencio, C.:Benoukraf, T.:Tirado-Magallanes, R.:Zhou, Q.:Burocziová, Monika:Rahmatová, S.:Pytlik, R.:Brdička, Tomáš:Tenen, D.G.:Kořínek, Vladimír:Alberich-Jorda, Meritxell",Blood,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Feed-based common carp farming and eutrophication: is there a reason for concern?,"Metadata from 70 research articles on Cyprinus carpio digestibility published between 1973 and 2017, covering 71 feed ingredients, were analysed. Interquartile range (IR) of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content in feedstuffs was 5-8% and 0.7-1.2% of dry matter, respectively, with digestible N:P 7.2:1-44.1:1. IR of N digestibility (79-99%) was high, whereas IR of P digestibility (27-47%) was rather poor. Dietary energy digestibility (gross energy and non-protein energy) was &gt,76%. Higher P in feedstuffs caused significant negative interferences for N digestibility. IR of nutrient content in carp faeces was estimated at 0.5-1.7% N and 0.4-0.9% P. Considering the metabolic losses, the carp excreta have an &apos,eutrophic&apos, N:P ratio (2.1:1-5.8:1). Eutrophication potential from feeding seems linked to P digestibility followed by bad protein profile of diets. While brewery wastes, microbial protein and natural prey offer high P digestibility (75-90%), large knowledge gaps still exist in P digestibility of various ingredients. Thermal processing does not always improve P digestibility, acidic pre-incubation with phytases (optimum: 1500-2000 IU kg(-1) feed) is worth exploring. Under semi-intensive system, digestible &apos,supplementary&apos, nutrients (N: 3.3-4.9%, P: 0.2-0.5%, even lower) can support at least 0.6-1.2 thermal growth coefficient (reasonable growth) and be ecologically relevant. We further considered validity of data within experimental conditions, effects on N/P utilization, non-faecal losses (IRs 17-59% of N intake, 9-18% of P intake), and controversies over eutrophication. Recent eutrophication of carp fishponds might have been rather &apos,management-driven&apos, than carp&apos,s biological limitations.

Achieving the ultimate optical resolution,"The Rayleigh criterion specifies the minimum separation between two incoherent point sources that may be resolved into distinct objects. We revisit this problem by examining the Fisher information required for resolving the two sources. The resulting Cramér-Rao bound gives the minimum error achievable for any unbiased estimator. When only the intensity in the image plane is recorded, this bound diverges as the separation between the sources tends to zero, an effect that has been dubbed the Rayleigh curse. Nonetheless, this curse can be lifted with suitable measurements.

As inferred from landslides dated to the Late Glacial and Holocene, glacial-interglacial transitions are the major intervals of enhanced landsliding, but the length of this interval varies between distinct types of landscapes.Future progress in the understanding of the relationships between landslides and Quaternary climate changes should benefit from the i) extension of datasets of dated landslides, ii) geographical expansion of dating studies to regions with a lack of chronologically determined landslides (e.g., tropics), iii) improvement of landslide-dating strategies involving the incorporation of independent palaeoclimatic proxies and iv) wider incorporation of numerical modeling within landslide-dating studies.",10508.0,"Pánek, Tomáš",Earth-Science Reviews,1,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The McGurk effect in the time of pandemic: Age-dependent adaptation to an environmental loss of visual speech cues,"Seeing a person&apos,s mouth move for [ga] while hearing [ba] often results in the perception of &quot,da.&quot, Such audiovisual integration of speech cues, known as the McGurk effect, is stable within but variable across individuals. When the visual or auditory cues are degraded, due to signal distortion or the perceiver&apos,s sensory impairment, reliance on cues via the impoverished modality decreases. This study tested whether cue-reliance adjustments due to exposure to reduced cue availability are persistent and transfer to subsequent perception of speech with all cues fully available. A McGurk experiment was administered at the beginning and after a month of mandatory face-mask wearing (enforced in Czechia during the 2020 pandemic). Responses to audio-visually incongruent stimuli were analyzed from 292 persons (ages 16-55), representing a cross-sectional sample, and 41 students (ages 19-27), representing a longitudinal sample. The extent to which the participants relied exclusively on visual cues was affected by testing time in interaction with age. After a month of reduced access to lipreading, reliance on visual cues (present at test) somewhat lowered for younger and increased for older persons. This implies that adults adapt their speech perception faculty to an altered environmental availability of multimodal cues, and that younger adults do so more efficiently. This finding demonstrates that besides sensory impairment or signal noise, which reduce cue availability and thus affect audio-visual cue reliance, having experienced a change in environmental conditions can modulate the perceiver&apos,s (otherwise relatively stable) general bias towards different modalities during speech communication.",60203.0,"Chládková, Kateřina:Podlipský, Václav Jonáš:Natalia, Nudga:Šimáčková, Šárka","PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp, REVIEW",1,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
DIS3L2 and LSm proteins are involved in the surveillance of Sm ring-deficient snRNAs,"Spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) undergo a complex maturation pathway containing multiple steps in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. snRNP biogenesis is strictly proof-read and several quality control checkpoints are placed along the pathway. Here, we analyzed the fate of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) that are unable to acquire a ring of Sm proteins. We showed that snRNAs lacking the Sm ring are unstable and accumulate in P-bodies in an LSm1-dependent manner. We further provide evidence that defective snRNAs without the Sm binding site are uridylated at the 3' end and associate with DIS3L2 3'-> 5' exoribonuclease and LSm proteins. Finally, inhibition of 5'-> 3' exoribonuclease XRN1 increases association of Delta Sm snRNAs with DIS3L2, which indicates competition and compensation between these two degradation enzymes. Together, we provide evidence that defective snRNAs without the Sm ring are uridylated and degraded by alternative pathways involving either DIS3L2 or LSm proteins and XRN1.",10608.0,"Roithová, Adriana:Feketová, Z.:Vanacova, S.:Staněk, David",Nucleic Acids Research,1,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Interaction pathways and structure-chemical transformations of alginate gels in physiological environments,"The remarkably diverse affinity of alginate (ALG) macromolecules for polyvalent metal ions makes cross-linked alginate gels an outstanding biomaterial. Surprisingly, however, very little is known about their interactions and structural transformations in physiological environments. To bridge this gap, we prepared a set of ALG gels cross-linked by various ions and monitored their structural changes at different media simulating gastric and intestinal fluids and cellular environments. For these studies, we used multinuclear solid-state NMR (ss-NMR) spectroscopy, which revealed a range of competitive ion-exchange and interconversion reactions, the rate of which strongly depended on the nature of the cross-linking metal ions. Depending on the environment, ALG chains adopted different forms, such as acidic (hydro)gels stabilized by strong hydrogen bonds, and/or weakly cross-linked Na/H-gels. Simultaneously, the exchanged polyvalent ions extensively interacted with the environment even forming in some cases insoluble phosphate microdomains directly deposited in the ALG bead matrix. The extent of the transformations and incorporation of secondary phases into the alginate beads followed the size and electronegativity of the cross-linking ions. Overall, the applied combination of various macroscopic and biological tests with multinuclear ss-NMR revealed a complex pathway of alginate beads transformations in physiological environments.",10404.0,"Urbanová, Martina:Pavelková, M.:Czernek, Jiří:Kubová, K.:Vysloužil, J.:Pechová, A.:Molinková, D.:Vysloužil, J.:Vetchý, D.:Brus, Jiří",Biomacromolecules,1,high,high,0,0,high,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To better understand Bordetella pertussis resurgence, we analyzed historic strains and recent clinical isolates by using a comparative omics approach. Whole-genome sequencing showed that historic and recent isolates of B. pertussis have substantial variation in genome organization and form separate phylogenetic clusters. Subsequent RNA sequence analysis and liquid chromatography with mass tandem spectrometry analyses showed that these variations translated into discretely separated transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. When compared with historic strains, recent isolates showed increased expression of flagellar genes and genes involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and decreased expression of polysaccharide capsule genes.

CDK11 is required for transcription of replication-dependent histone genes,"CDK11 functions with histone pre-mRNA-processing factor FLASH to upregulate expression of replication-dependent histone genes in S phase and to couple transcription and processing of nascent histone transcripts in mammalian cells. Replication-dependent histones (RDH) are required for packaging of newly synthetized DNA into nucleosomes during the S phase when their expression is highly upregulated. However, the mechanisms of this upregulation in metazoan cells remain poorly understood. Using iCLIP and ChIP-seq, we found that human cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) associates with RNA and chromatin of RDH genes primarily in the S phase. Moreover, its amino-terminal region binds FLASH, an RDH-specific 3 '-end processing factor, which keeps the kinase on the chromatin. CDK11 phosphorylates serine 2 (Ser2) of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is initiated when RNAPII reaches the middle of RDH genes and is required for further RNAPII elongation and 3 '-end processing. CDK11 depletion leads to decreased number of cells in S phase, likely owing to the function of CDK11 in RDH gene expression. Thus, the reliance of RDH expression on CDK11 could explain why CDK11 is essential for the growth of many cancers.",10608.0,"Gajdušková, Pavla:de los Mozos, I.R.:Rájecký, Michal:Hluchý, Milan:Ule, J.:Blažek, Dalibor",NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Structure of an H1-Bound 6-Nucleosome Array Reveals an Untwisted Two-Start Chromatin Fiber Conformation,"Chromatin adopts a diversity of regular and irregular fiber structures in vitro and in vivo.

We report the 9.7 angstrom resolution crystal structure of a 6-nucleosome array bound to linker histone H1 determined under ionic conditions that favor incomplete chromatin condensation. The structure reveals a flat two-start helix with uniform nucleosomal stacking interfaces and a nucleosome packing density that is only half that of a twisted 30-nm fiber. Hydroxyl radical footprinting indicates that H1 binds the array in an on-dyad configuration resembling that observed for mononucleosomes.

The Visual Process: Immediate or Successive? Approaches to the Extramission Postulate in 13th Century Theories of Vision,"Is vision merely a state of the beholder’s sensory organ which can be explained as  an  immediate  effect  caused  by  external  sensible  objects?  Or  is  it  rather  a  successive process in which the observer actively scanning the surrounding en-vironment  plays  a  major  part?  These  two  general  attitudes  towards  visual  perception  were  both  developed  already  by  ancient  thinkers.  The  former  is  embraced  by  natural  philosophers  (e.g.,  atomists  and  Aristotelians)  and  is  often  labelled  “intromissionist,”  based  on  their  assumption  that  vision  is  an  outcome of the causal influence exerted by an external object upon a sensory organ receiving an entity from the object. The latter attitude to vision as a suc-cessive process is rather linked to the “extramissionist” theories of the proponents  of  geometrical  optics  (such  as  Euclid  or  Ptolemy)  who  suggest  that  an  entity – a visual ray – is sent forth from the eyes to the object.

Cryptochrome 2 mediates directional magnetoreception in cockroaches,"The ability to perceive geomagnetic fields (GMFs) represents a fascinating biological phenomenon. Studies on transgenic flies have provided evidence that photosensitive Cryptochromes (Cry) are involved in the response to magnetic fields (MFs). However, none of the studies tackled the problem of whether the Cry-dependent magnetosensitivity is coupled to the sole MF presence or to the direction of MF vector. In this study, we used gene silencing and a directional MF to show that mammalian-like Cry2 is necessary for a genuine directional response to periodic rotations of the GMF vector in two insect species. Longer wavelengths of light required higher photon fluxes for a detectable behavioral response, and a sharp detection border was present in the cyan/green spectral region. Both observations are consistent with involvement of the FADox, FAD- and FADH- redox forms of flavin. The response was lost upon covering the eyes, demonstrating that the signal is perceived in the eye region.

Rationally inattentive seller: sales and discrete pricing,"Prices tend to remain constant for a period of time and then jump. In the literature, this “rigidity is usually interpreted to reflect a cost of adjusting prices. This article shows that price rigidity can alternatively reflect optimal price setting when there are no adjustment costs, namely, if the seller is rationally inattentive. The model generates non-trivial pricing patterns that are consistent with the data and that are hard to explain with the traditional adjustment-cost model. In particular, prices are adjusted frequently but move back and forth between a few given values, hazard functions are downward sloping, and responses to persistent shocks are sluggish.

Formation of spermatogonia and fertile oocytes in golden hamsters requires piRNAs,"A set of three papers reports that the piRNA pathway is essential for mammalian female fertility based on genetic perturbation experiments performed in golden hamsters.nnPIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) support the germline by suppressing retrotransposons. Studies of the pathway in mice have strongly shaped the view that mammalian piRNAs are essential for male but not for female fertility. Here, we report that the role of the piRNA pathway substantially differs in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), the piRNA pathway setup of which more closely resembles that of other mammals, including humans. The loss of the Mov10l1 RNA helicase-an essential piRNA biogenesis factor-leads to striking phenotypes in both sexes. In contrast to mice, female Mov10l1(-/-) hamsters are sterile because their oocytes do not sustain zygotic development. Furthermore, Mov10l1(-/-) male hamsters have impaired establishment of spermatogonia accompanied by transcriptome dysregulation and an expression surge of a young retrotransposon subfamily. Our results show that the mammalian piRNA pathway has essential roles in both sexes and its adaptive nature allows it to manage emerging genomic threats and acquire new critical roles in the germline.",10604.0,"Loubalová, S.:Fulka, Helena:Horvat, F.:Pasulka, J.:Malík, R.:Hirose, M.:Ogura, A.:Svoboda, P.",Nature Cell Biology,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Palaeo-Eskimo genetic ancestry and the peopling of Chukotka and North America,"Much of the American Arctic was first settled 5,000 years ago, by groups of people known as Palaeo-Eskimos. They were subsequently joined and largely displaced around 1,000 years ago by ancestors of the present-day Inuit and Yup'ik(1-3). The genetic relationship between Palaeo-Eskimos and Native American, Inuit, Yup'ik and Aleut populations remains uncertain(4-6). Here we present genomic data for 48 ancient individuals from Chukotka, East Siberia, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the Canadian Arctic. We co-analyse these data with data from present-day Alaskan Inupiat and West Siberian populations and published genomes. Using methods based on rare-allele and haplotype sharing, as well as established techniques(4,7-9), we show that Palaeo-Eskimo-related ancestry is ubiquitous among people who speak Na-Dene and Eskimo-Aleut languages. We develop a comprehensive model for the Holocene peopling events of Chukotka and North America, and show that Na-Dene-speaking peoples, people of the Aleutian Islands, and Yup'ik and Inuit across the Arctic region all share ancestry from a single Palaeo-Eskimo-related Siberian source.",10602.0,"Flegontov, Pavel:Altinişik, Nefize Ezgi:Changmai, Piya:Rohland, N.:Mallick, S.:Adamski, N.:Bolnick, DA:Broomandkhoshbacht, N.:Candilio, F.:Culleton, BJ:Flegontova, O.:Friesen, TM:Jeong, C.:Harper, TK:Keating, D.:Kennett, DJ:Kim, AM:Lamnidis, TC:Lawson, AM:Olalde, I.:Oppenheimer, J.:Potter, BA:Raff, J.:Sattler, RA:Skoglund, P.:Stewardson, K.:Vajda, EJ:Vasilyev, S.:Veselovskaya, E.:Hayes, MG:O Rourke, DH:Krause, J.:Pinhasi, R.:Reich, D.:Schiffels, S.",Nature,1,high,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

uS3/Rps3 controls fidelity of translation termination and programmed stop codon readthrough in co-operation with eIF3,"Ribosome was long considered as a critical yet passive player in protein synthesis. Only recently the role of its basic components, ribosomal RNAs and proteins, in translational control has begun to emerge. Here we examined function of the small ribosomal protein uS3/Rps3, earlier shown to interact with eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3, in termination. We identified two residues in consecutive helices occurring in the mRNA entry pore, whose mutations to the opposite charge either reduced (K108E) or increased (R116D) stop codon readthrough. Whereas the latter increased overall levels of eIF3-containing terminating ribosomes in heavy polysomes in vivo indicating slower termination rates, the former specifically reduced eIF3 amounts in termination complexes. Combining these two mutations with the readthrough-reducing mutations at the extreme C-terminus of the a/Tif32 subunit of eIF3 either suppressed (R116D) or exacerbated (K108E) the readthrough phenotypes, and partially corrected or exacerbated the defects in the composition of termination complexes. In addition, we found that K108 affects efficiency of termination in the termination context-specific manner by promoting incorporation of readthrough-inducing tRNAs. Together with the multiple binding sites that we identified between these two proteins, we suggest that Rps3 and eIF3 closely co-operate to control translation termination and stop codon readthrough.",10606.0,"Poncová, Kristýna:Wagner, Susan:Jansen, Myrte Esmeralda:Beznosková, Petra:Gunišová, Stanislava:Herrmannová, Anna:Zeman, Jakub:Dong, J.S.:Valášek, Leoš Shivaya",Nucleic Acids Research,1,medium,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Protein diversity in discrete structures at the distal tip of the trypanosome flagellum,"The distal end of the eukaryotic flagellum/cilium is important for axonemal growth and signaling and has distinct biomechanical properties. Specific flagellum tip structures exist, yet their composition, dynamics, and functions are largely unknown. We used biochemical approaches to identify seven constituents of the flagella connector at the tip of an assembling trypanosome flagellum and three constituents of the axonemal capping structure at the tips of both assembling and mature flagella. Both tip structures contain evolutionarily conserved as well as kinetoplastid-specific proteins, and component assembly into the structures occurs very early during flagellum extension. Localization and functional studies reveal that the flagella connector membrane junction is attached to the tips of extending microtubules of the assembling flagellum by a kinesin-15 family member. On the opposite side, a kinetoplastidspecific kinesin facilitates attachment of the junction to the microtubules in the mature flagellum.

Substrate mechanics controls adipogenesis through YAP phosphorylation by dictating cell spreading,"The mechanoregulated proteins YAP/TAZ are involved in the adipogenic/osteogenic switch of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSC fate decision can be unbalanced by controlling substrate mechanics, in turn altering the transmission of tension through cell cytoskeleton. MSCs have been proposed for orthopedic and reconstructive surgery applications. Thus, a tight control of their adipogenic potential is required in order to avoid their drifting towards fat tissue. Substrate mechanics has been shown to drive MSC commitment and to regulate YAP/TAZ protein shuttling and turnover. The mechanism by which YAP/TAZ co-transcriptional activity is mechanically regulated during MSC fate acquisition is still debated. Here, we design few bioengineering tools suited to disentangle the contribution of mechanical from biological stimuli to MSC adipogenesis. We demonstrate that the mechanical repression of YAP happens through its phosphorylation, is purely mediated by cell spreading downstream of substrate mechanics as dictated by dimensionality. YAP repression is sufficient to prompt MSC adipogenesis, regardless of a permissive biological environment, TEAD nuclear presence or focal adhesion stabilization. Finally, by harnessing the potential of YAP mechanical regulation, we propose a practical example of the exploitation of adipogenic transdifferentiation in tumors.",20602.0,"Oliver De La Cruz, Jorge:Nardone, Giorgia:Vrbský, Jan:Pompeiano, Antonio:Perestrelo, Ana Rubina:Capradossi, Francesco:Melajová, Katarína:Filipenský, Petr:Forte, Giancarlo",BIOMATERIALS,1,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a context-aware blind evaluation by human judges, CUBBITT significantly outperformed professional-agency English-to-Czech news translation in preserving text meaning (translation adequacy). While human translation is still rated as more fluent, CUBBITT is shown to be substantially more fluent than previous state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, most participants of a Translation Turing test struggle to distinguish CUBBITT translations from human translations. This work approaches the quality of human translation and even surpasses it in adequacy in certain circumstances.

Prevalent lightning sferics at 600 megahertz near Jupiter’s poles,"Lightning has been detected on Jupiter by all visiting spacecraft through night-side optical imaging and whistler (lightning-generated radio waves) signatures. Jovian lightning is thought to be generated in the mixed-phase (liquid–ice) region of convective water clouds through a charge-separation process between condensed liquid water and water-ice particles, similar to that of terrestrial (cloud-to-cloud) lightning. Unlike terrestrial lightning, which emits broadly over the radio spectrum up to gigahertz frequencies, lightning on Jupiter has been detected only at kilohertz frequencies, despite a search for signals in the megahertz range. Strong ionospheric attenuation or a lightning discharge much slower than that on Earth have been suggested as possible explanations for this discrepancy. Here we report observations of Jovian lightning sferics (broadband electromagnetic impulses) at 600 megahertz from the Microwave Radiometer onboard the Juno spacecraft. These detections imply that Jovian lightning discharges are not distinct from terrestrial lightning, as previously thought. In the first eight orbits of Juno, we detected 377 lightning sferics from pole to pole. We found lightning to be prevalent in the polar regions, absent near the equator, and most frequent in the northern hemisphere, at latitudes higher than 40 degrees north. Because the distribution of lightning is a proxy for moist convective activity, which is thought to be an important source of outward energy transport from the interior of the planet, increased convection towards the poles could indicate an outward internal heat flux that is preferentially weighted towards the poles. The distribution of moist convection is important for understanding the composition, general circulation and energy transport on Jupiter.",10305.0,"Brown, S.:Janssen, M.:Adumitroaie, V.:Atreya, S.:Bolton, S.:Gulkis, S.:Ingersoll, A.:Levin, S.:Li, Ch.:Li, L.:Lunine, J.:Misra, S.:Orton, G.:Steffes, P.:Tabataba-Vakili, F.:Kolmašová, Ivana:Imai, M.:Santolík, Ondřej:Kurth, W.:Hospodarsky, G.:Gurnett, D.:Connerney, J.",Nature,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pharmacological inhibition of fatty-acid oxidation synergistically enhances the effect of L-asparaginase in childhood ALL cells,"L-asparaginase (ASNase), a key component in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), hydrolyzes plasma asparagine and glutamine and thereby disturbs metabolic homeostasis of leukemic cells.

Therefore, we studied the impact of ASNase on the main metabolic pathways in leukemic cells. Treatingleukemic cells with ASNase increased fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) and cell respiration and inhibited glycolysis. FAO, together with the decrease in protein translation and pyrimidine synthesis, was positively regulated through inhibition of the RagB-mTORC1pathway, whereas the effect on glycolysis was RagB-mTORC1 independent.

Bright and photostable chemigenetic indicators for extended in vivo voltage imaging,"Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) enable monitoring of neuronal activity at high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the utility of existing GEVIs has been limited by the brightness and photostability of fluorescent proteins and rhodopsins. We engineered a GEVI, called Voltron, that uses bright and photostable synthetic dyes instead of protein-based fluorophores, thereby extending the number of neurons imaged simultaneously in vivo by a factor of 10 and enabling imaging for significantly longer durations relative to existing GEVIs. We used Voltron for in vivo voltage imaging in mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies. In the mouse cortex, Voltron allowed single-trial recording of spikes and subthreshold voltage signals from dozens of neurons simultaneously over a 15-minute period of continuous imaging.

Targeting Mitochondrial Iron Metabolism Suppresses Tumor Growth and Metastasis by Inducing Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Mitophagy,"Deferoxamine (DFO) represents a widely used iron chelator for the treatment of iron overload. Here we describe the use of mitochondrially targeted deferoxamine (mitoDFO) as a novel approach to preferentially target cancer cells. The agent showed marked cytostatic, cytotoxic, and migrastatic properties in vitro, and it significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. The underlying molecular mechanisms included (I) impairment of [Fe-S] cluster/heme biogenesis, leading to destabilization and loss of activity of [Fe-S] cluster/heme containing enzymes, (II) inhibition of mitochondrial respiration leading to mitochondrial ROS production, resulting in dysfunctional mitochondria with markedly reduced supercomplexes, and (III) fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and induction of mitophagy. Mitochondrial targeting of DFO represents a way to deprive cancer cells of biologically active iron, which is incompatible with their proliferation and invasion, without disrupting systemic iron metabolism. Our findings highlight the importance of mitochondrial iron metabolism for cancer cells and demonstrate repurposing deferoxamine into an effective anti-cancer drug via mitochondrial targeting.",30204.0,"Sandoval-Acuna, Cristian:Torrealba, Natalia:Tomkova, Veronika:Jadhav, Sukanya B.:Blažková, Kristýna:Merta, L.:Lettlová, Sandra:Adamcová, Miroslava Kari:Rosel, D.:Brabek, J.:Neužil, Jiří:Štursa, Jan:Werner, Lukáš:Truksa, Jaroslav",Cancer Research,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0
Aire-expressing ILC3-like cells in the lymph node display potent APC features,"The autoimmune regulator (Aire) serves an essential function for T cell tolerance by promoting the ´promiscuous´ expression of tissue antigens in thymic epithelial cells.

Here, we report that Aire protein-expressing cells in lymph nodes exhibit typical group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) characteristics such as lymphoid morphology, absence of ´classical´ hematopoietic lineage markers, and dependence on ROR gamma t. Aire(+) cells are more frequent among lineage-negative ROR gamma t(+) cells of peripheral lymph nodes as compared with mucosa-draining lymph nodes, display a unique Aire-dependent transcriptional signature, express high surface levels of MHCII and costimulatory molecules, and efficiently present an endogenously expressed model antigen to CD4(+).

Studying and Discussing Optics at the Prague Faculty of Arts: Optical Topics and Authorities in Prague Quodlibets and John of Borotín’s Quaestio on Extramission,"The paper presents a preliminary estimation of the extent of dissemination of optical texts, ideas, and issues among the masters connected with the Prague faculty of arts in the late 14th and early 15th century. Investigation of this topic, so far rather neglected, is based chiefly on manuscript research. The paper brings evidence that perspectiva was taught in Prague at least since the 1370s. It suggests that investigation of Prague quodlibetal disputations (ca. 1390s – 1410s) and consideration of perspectivist authorities employed in these texts can also shed some light on the issue. However, the paper is mainly devoted to the question on the mechanism of vision disputed by Bohemian arts master John of Borotín (Iohannes de Borotin, 1378 – after 1458) in the quodlibet organised by John Hus in 1411. It is suggested that the single extant exemplar of the question (preserved in the codex Prague, National Library, X.H.18) probably is Borotín’s autograph. The structure and sources of the question are analysed, with the conclusion being that Borotín proposes a compromise between intromission and extramission influenced by John Peckham’s Perspectiva communis.

Spatial navigation deficits - overlooked cognitive marker for preclinical Alzheimer disease?,"Detection of incipient Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology is critical to identify preclinical individuals and target potentially disease-modifying therapies towards them. Current neuroimaging and biomarker research is strongly focused in this direction, with the aim of establishing AD fingerprints to identify individuals at high risk of developing this disease. By contrast, cognitive fingerprints for incipient AD are virtually non-existent as diagnostics and outcomes measures are still focused on episodic memory deficits as the gold standard for AD, despite their low sensitivity and specificity for identifying at-risk individuals. This Review highlights a novel feature of cognitive evaluation for incipient AD by focusing on spatial navigation and orientation deficits, which are increasingly shown to be present in at-risk individuals. Importantly, the navigation system in the brain overlaps substantially with the regions affected by AD in both animal models and humans. Notably, spatial navigation has fewer verbal, cultural and educational biases than current cognitive tests and could enable a more uniform, global approach towards cognitive fingerprints of AD and better cognitive treatment outcome measures in future multicentre trials. The current Review appraises the available evidence for spatial navigation and/or orientation deficits in preclinical, prodromal and confirmed AD and identifies research gaps and future research priorities.",30103.0,"Coughlan, Gillian:Laczó, Jan:Hort, Jakub:Minihane, Anne-Marie:Hornberger, Michael",Nature Reviews Neurology,1,high,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides induce membrane multilamellarity and subsequently enter via formation of a fusion pore,"Arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides do not enter cells by directly passing through a lipid membrane, they instead passively enter vesicles and live cells by inducing membrane multilamellarity and fusion. The molecular picture of this penetration mode, which differs qualitatively from the previously proposed direct mechanism, is provided by molecular dynamics simulations. The kinetics of vesicle agglomeration and fusion by an iconic cell-penetrating peptide-nonaarginine-are documented via real-time fluorescence techniques, while the induction of multilamellar phases in vesicles and live cells is demonstrated by a combination of electron and fluorescence microscopies.

"Enzymatic Preparation of 2′–5′,3′–5′-Cyclic Dinucleotides, Their Binding Properties to Stimulator of Interferon Genes Adaptor Protein, and Structure/Activity Correlations","Cyclic dinucleotides are second messengers in the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which plays an important role in recognizing tumor cells and viral or bacterial infections. They bind to the STING adaptor protein and trigger expression of cytokines via TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) signaling cascades. In this work, we describe an enzymatic preparation of 2′-5′,3′-5′-cyclic dinucleotides (2′3′CDNs) with use of cyclic GMP-AMP synthases (cGAS) from human, mouse, and chicken. We profile substrate specificity of these enzymes by employing a small library of nucleotide-5′-triphosphate (NTP) analogues and use them to prepare 33 2′3′CDNs. We also determine affinity of these CDNs to five different STING haplotypes in cell-based and biochemical assays and describe properties needed for their optimal activity toward all STING haplotypes. Next, we study their effect on cytokine and chemokine induction by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and evaluate their cytotoxic effect on monocytes.

Maleness-on-the-Y (MoY) orchestrates male sex determination in major agricultural fruit fly pests,"In insects, rapidly evolving primary sex-determining signals are transduced by a conserved regulatory module controlling sexual differentiation. In the agricultural pest Ceratitis capitata (Mediterranean fruit fly, Medfly) we identified a Y-linked gene, Maleness-on the-Y (MoY), encoding a small protein that is necessary and sufficient for male development. Silencing or disruption of MoY in XY embryos causes feminization whereas overexpression of MoY in XX embryos induces masculinization. Crosses between transformed XY females and XX males give rise to males and females, indicating that a Y chromosome can be transmitted by XY females.

Bacterial nanotubes as a manifestation of cell death,"Bacterial nanotubes are membranous structures that have been reported to function as conduits between cells to exchange DNA, proteins, and nutrients. Here, we investigate the morphology and formation of bacterial nanotubes using Bacillus subtilis. We show that nanotube formation is associated with stress conditions, and is highly sensitive to the cells' genetic background, growth phase, and sample preparation methods. Remarkably, nanotubes appear to be extruded exclusively from dying cells, likely as a result of biophysical forces. Their emergence is extremely fast, occurring within seconds by cannibalizing the cell membrane. Subsequent experiments reveal that cell-to-cell transfer of non-conjugative plasmids depends strictly on the competence system of the cell, and not on nanotube formation. Our study thus supports the notion that bacterial nanotubes are a post mortem phenomenon involved in cell disintegration, and are unlikely to be involved in cytoplasmic content exchange between live cells. Bacterial nanotubes and other similar membranous structures have been reported to function as conduits between cells to exchange DNA, proteins, and nutrients.

Topologically Associated Domains Delineate Susceptibility to Somatic Hypermutation,"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) introduces point mutations into immunoglobulin (Ig) genes but also causes mutations in other parts of the genome. We have used lentiviral SHM reporter vectors to identify regions of the genome that are susceptible (´hot´) and resistant (´cold´) to SHM, revealing that SHM susceptibility and resistance are often properties of entire topologically associated domains (TADs). Comparison of hot and cold TADs reveals that while levels of transcription are equivalent, hot TADs are enriched for the cohesin loader NIPBL, super-enhancers, markers of paused/stalled RNA polymerase 2, and multiple important B cell transcription factors. We demonstrate that at least some hot TADs contain enhancers that possess SHM targeting activity and that insertion of a strong Ig SHM-targeting element into a cold TAD renders it hot. Our findings lead to a model for SHM susceptibility involving the cooperative action of cis-acting SHM targeting elements and the dynamic and architectural properties of TADs.",30102.0,"Šenigl, Filip:Maman, Y.:Dinesh, R.

A ubiquitous disordered protein interaction module orchestrates transcription elongation,"During eukaryotic transcription elongation, RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) is regulated by a chorus of factors. Here, we identified a common binary interaction module consisting of TFIIS N-terminal domains (TNDs) and natively unstructured TND-interacting motifs (TIMs). This module was conserved among the elongation machinery and linked complexes including transcription factor TFIIS, Mediator, super elongation complex, elongin, IWS1, SPT6, PP1-PNUTS phosphatase, H3K36me3 readers, and other factors. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, live-cell microscopy, and mass spectrometry, we revealed the structural basis for these interactions and found that TND-TIM sequences were necessary and sufficient to induce strong and specific colocalization in the crowded nuclear environment. Disruption of a single TIM in IWS1 induced robust changes in gene expression and RNAP2 elongation dynamics, which underscores the functional importance of TND-TIM surfaces for transcription elongation.",10608.0,"Čermáková, Kateřina:Demeulemeester, J.:Lux, Vanda:Nedomová, Monika:Goldman, S.

Measurements of continuum lowering in solid-density plasmas created from elements and compounds,"The effect of a dense plasma environment on the energy levels of an embedded ion is usually described in terms of the lowering of its continuum level. For strongly coupled plasmas, the phenomenon is intimately related to the equation of state, hence, an accurate treatment is crucial for most astrophysical and inertial-fusion applications, where the case of plasma mixtures is of particular interest. Here we present an experiment showing that the standard density-dependent analytical models are inadequate to describe solid-density plasmas at the temperatures studied, where the reduction of the binding energies for a given species is unaffected by the different plasma environment (ion density) in either the element or compounds of that species, and can be accurately estimated by calculations only involving the energy levels of an isolated neutral atom.

Ramsey numbers and monotone colorings,"For positive integers N and r &gt,= 2, an r-monotone coloring of ({1,...,N} choose r) is a 2-coloring by -1 and +1 that is monotone on the lexicographically ordered sequence of r-tuples of every (r+1)-tuple from ({1,...,N} choose r+1). Let R(n,r) be the minimum N such that every r-monotone coloring of ({1,...,N} choose r) contains a monochromatic copy of ({1,...,n} choose r). For every r &gt,= 3, it is known that R(n,r) &lt,= tow_(r-1)(O(n)), where tow_h(x) is the tower function of height h-1 defined as tow_1(x)=x and tow_h(x) = 2^(tow_(h-1)(x)) for h &gt,= 2. The Erdős-Szekeres Lemma and the Erdős-Szekeres Theorem imply R(n,2) = (n-1)^2+1 and R(n,3) = (2n-4 choose n-2) + 1, respectively. It follows from a result of Eliáš and Matoušek that R(n,4) &gt,= tow_3(Omega(n)). We show that R(n,r) &gt,= tow_(r-1)(Omega(n)) for every r &gt,= 3 . This, in particular, solves an open problem posed by Eliáš and Matoušek and by Moshkovitz and Shapira. Using two geometric interpretations of monotone colorings, we show connections between estimating and two Ramsey-type problems that have been recently considered by several researchers. Namely, we show connections with higher-order Erdős-Szekeres theorems and with Ramsey-type problems for order-type homogeneous sequences of points. We also prove that the number of r-monotone colorings of ({1,...,N} choose r) is 2^(N^(r-1)/r^(Theta(r))) for N &gt,= r &gt,= 3, which generalizes the well-known fact that the number of simple arrangements of N pseudolines is 2^(Theta(N^2)).",10101.0,"Balko, Martin",Journal of Combinatorial Theory - Series A,1,high,high,1,1,high,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Chapter Three - Rationale for the Combination of Dendritic Cell-Based Vaccination Approaches With Chemotherapy Agents,"Owing to their central role in the initiation and regulation of antitumor immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) have been widely tested for use in cancer immunotherapy. Despite several encouraging clinical applications, existing DC-based immunotherapy efforts have yielded inconsistent results. Recent work has identified strategies that may allow for more potent DC-based vaccines, such as the combination with antitumor agents that have the potential to synergistically enhance DC functions. Selected cytotoxic agents may stimulate DCs either by directly promoting their maturation or through the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Moreover, they may support DC-induced adaptive immune responses by disrupting tumor-induced immunosuppressive mechanisms via selective depletion or inhibition of regulatory subsets, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and/or regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here, we summarize our current knowledge on the capacity of anticancer chemotherapeutics to modulate DC phenotype and functions and the results of ongoing clinical trials evaluating the use of DC-based immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy in cancer patients.",10600.0,"Truxová, Iva:Hensler, Michal:Škapa, Petr:Halaška, Michael J.:Laco, Jan:Ryška, Aleš:Špíšek, Radek:Fučíková, Jitka","International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology, Volume 330",1,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For equally bright sources, the Cramér-Rao bound is independent of their separation, which confirms that the Rayleigh resolution limit is just an artifact of the conventional direct imaging and can be overcome with an adequate strategy. For the general case of unequally bright sources, the amount of information one can gain about the separation falls to zero, but we show that there is always a quadratic improvement in an optimal detection in comparison with the intensity measurements.

Trans-generational neurochemical modulation of methamphetamine in the adult brain of the Wistar rat,"Chronic methamphetamine (METH) abuse has been shown to elicit strong neurotoxic effects. Yet, with an increasing number of children born to METH abusing mothers maturing into adulthood, one important question is how far do the neurotoxic effects of METH alter various neurotransmitter systems in the adult METH-exposed offspring. The purpose of this study was to investigate long-term trans-generational neurochemical changes, following prenatal METH exposure, in the adult Wistar rat brain. METH or saline (SAL-control animals) was administered to pregnant dams throughout the entire gestation period (G0-G22). At postnatal day 90, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA were measured in the adult brain before (baseline) and after a METH re-administration using in vivo microdialysis and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results show that METH-exposure increased basal levels of monoamines and glutamate, but decreased GABA levels in all measured brain regions. Acute challenge with METH injection in the METH-exposed group induced a lower increase in the monoamine system relative to the increase in the GABAergic and glutamatergic system. The data show that prenatal METH exposure has strong effects on the monoaminergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic system even when exposure to METH was limited to the prenatal phase. Toxicological effects of METH have therefore longer lasting effects as currently considered and seem to affect the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the brain having strong implications for cognitive and behavioral functioning.",30103.0,"Fujáková-Lipski, Michaela:Kaping, Daniel:Šírová, Jana:Horáček, Jiří:Páleníček, Tomáš:Zach, Petr:Klaschka, Jan:Kačer, Petr:Syslová, Kamila:Vrajová, Monika:Bubeníková-Valešová, Věra:Beste, Christian:Šlamberová, Romana",Archives of Toxicology,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Sentinel lymph node mapping and intraoperative assessment in a prospective, international, multicentre, observational trial of patients with cervical cancer: The SENTIX trial","Background: SENTIX (ENGOT-CX2/CEEGOG-CX1) is an international, multi centre, prospective observational trial evaluating sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy without pelvic lymph node dissection in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. We report the final preplanned analysis of the secondary end-points: SLN mapping and outcomes of intraoperative SLN pathology. Methods: Forty-seven sites (18 countries) with experience of SLN biopsy participated in SENTIX. We preregistered patients with stage IA1/lymphovascular space invasion-positive to IB2 (4 cm or smaller or 2 cm or smaller for fertility-sparing treatment) cervical cancer without suspicious lymph nodes on imaging before surgery. SLN frozen section assessment and pathological ultrastaging were mandatory. Patients were registered postoperatively if SLN were bilaterally detected in the pelvis, and frozen sections were negative. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02494063). Results: We analysed data for 395 preregistered patients. Bilateral detection was achieved in 91% (355/395), and it was unaffected by tumour size, tumour stage or body mass index, but it was lower in older patients, in patients who underwent open surgery, and in sites with fewer cases. No SLN were found outside the seven anatomical pelvic regions. Most SLN and positive SLN were localised below the common iliac artery bifurcation. Single positive SLN above the iliac bifurcation were found in 2% of cases. Frozen sections failed to detect 54% of positive lymph nodes (pN1), including 28% of cases with macrometastases and 90% with micrometastases. Interpretation: SLN biopsy can achieve high bilateral SLN detection in patients with tumours of 4 cm or smaller. At experienced centres, all SLN were found in the pelvis, and most were located below the iliac vessel bifurcation.

Mechanism-Based Fluorogenic trans-Cyclooctene-Tetrazine Cycloaddition,"The development of fluorogenic reactions which lead to the formation of fluorescent products from two nonfluorescent starting materials is highly desirable, but challenging. Reported herein is a new concept of fluorescent product formation upon the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction of 1,2,4,5-tetrazines with particular trans-cyclo-octene (TCO) isomers. In sharp contrast to known fluorogenic reagents the presented chemistry leads to the rapid formation of unprecedented fluorescent 1,4-dihydropyridazines so that the fluorophore is built directly upon the chemical reaction. Attachment of an extra fluorophore moiety is therefore not needed. The photochemical properties of the resulting dyes can be easily tuned by changing the substitution pattern of the starting 1,2,4,5-tetrazine.

The stability of block variants of classical Gram-Schmidt,"The block version of the classical Gram--Schmidt (tt BCGS) method is often employed to efficiently compute orthogonal bases for Krylov subspace methods and eigenvalue solvers, but a rigorous proof of its stability behavior has not yet been established. It is shown that the usual implementation of tt BCGS can lose orthogonality at a rate worse than $O(varepsilon) kappa^{2}({$mathcalX$})$, where $mathcal{X}$ is the input matrix and $varepsilon$ is the unit roundoff. A useful intermediate quantity denoted as the Cholesky residual is given special attention and, along with a block generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, this quantity is used to develop more stable variants of tt BCGS. These variants are proven to have $O(varepsilon) kappa^2({$mathcalX$})$ loss of orthogonality with relatively relaxed conditions on the intrablock orthogonalization routine satisfied by the most commonly used algorithms.

Photoelectron spectra of alkali metal-ammonia microjets: From blue electrolyte to bronze metal,"Experimental studies of the electronic structure of excess electrons in liquids—archetypal quantum solutes—have been largely restricted to very dilute electron concentrations. We overcame this limitation by applying soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize excess electrons originating from steadily increasing amounts of alkali metals dissolved in refrigerated liquid ammonia microjets. As concentration rises, a narrow peak at ~2 electron volts, corresponding to vertical photodetachment of localized solvated electrons and dielectrons, transforms continuously into a band with a sharp Fermi edge accompanied by a plasmon peak, characteristic of delocalized metallic electrons. Through our experimental approach combined with ab initio calculations of localized electrons and dielectrons, we obtain a clear picture of the energetics and density of states of the ammoniated electrons over the gradual transition from dilute blue electrolytes to concentrated bronze metallic solutions.",10403.0,"Buttersack, Tillmann:Mason, Philip E.:McMullen, R.

The importance of recognizing difference: Rethinking Central and East European Environmentalism,"This article adds to the literature interrogating existing hierarchies in global knowledge production by examining the dominant research on post-1989 Central and East European (CEE) environmentalism. Analyses of CEE environmentalism have predominantly relied on concepts and organizational models generated by research on environmental activism and politics conducted in Western contexts, resulting in negative assessments of CEE as lacking environmental engagement. This article proposes to re-think CEE environmentalism, arguing for a more positive perspective that takes into account the various traditional practices and informal outdoor and nature-based educational activities that have a long history in CEE. These originated to promote everyday pro-environmental behaviours that are motivated by a desire for authenticity, ethical living and personal integrity.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to quantify iron concentrations in deep gray matter structures using quantitative susceptibility mapping MRI and to characterize metabolic abnormalities in the pyramidal pathway using 1H MR spectroscopy in clinically manifesting membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration patients and asymptomatic C19orf12 gene mutation heterozygous carriers. Methods: We present data of 4 clinically affected membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration patients (mean age: 21.0 +- 2.9 years) and 9 heterozygous gene mutation carriers (mean age: 50.4 +- 9.8 years), compared to age-matched healthy controls. MRI assessments were performed on a 7.0 Tesla whole-body system, consisting of whole-brain gradient-echo scans and short echo time, single-volume MR spectroscopy in the white matter of the precentral/postcentral gyrus. Quantitative susceptibility mapping, a surrogate marker for iron concentration, was performed using a state-of-the-art multiscale dipole inversion approach with focus on the globus pallidus, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and SN. Results and Conclusion: In membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration patients, magnetic susceptibilities were 2 to 3 times higher in the globus pallidus (P = 0.02) and SN (P = 0.02) compared to controls. In addition, significantly higher magnetic susceptibility was observed in the caudate nucleus (P = 0.02). Non-manifesting heterozygous mutation carriers exhibited significantly increased magnetic susceptibility (relative to controls) in the putamen (P = 0.003) and caudate nucleus (P = 0.001), which may be an endophenotypic marker of genetic heterozygosity. MR spectroscopy revealed significantly increased levels of glutamate, taurine, and the combined concentration of glutamate and glutamine in membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration, which may be a correlate of corticospinal pathway dysfunction frequently observed in membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration patients.",30103.0,"Dušek, Petr:Mekle, Ralf:Skowronska, Marta:Acosta-Cabronero, Julio:Huelnhagen, Till:Robinson, Simon Daniel:Schubert, Florian:Deschauer, Marcus:Els, Antje:Ittermann, Bernd:Schottmann, Gudrun:Madai, Vince I:Paul, Friedemann:Klopstock, Thomas:Kmiec, Tomasz:Niendorf, Thoralf:Wuerfel, Jens:Schneider, Susanne A",Movement Disorders,1,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Transport of Nucleoside Triphosphates into Cells by Artificial Molecular Transporters,"Chemically modified nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) are widely exploited as unnatural metabolites in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. Because anionic NTPs do not permeate cell membranes, their corresponding neutral precursors are employed in cell-based assays. These precursors become active metabolites after enzymatic conversion, which often proceeds insufficiently. Here we show that metabolically-active NTPs can be directly transported into eukaryotic cells and bacteria by the action of designed synthetic nucleoside triphosphate transporters (SNTTs). The transporter is composed of a receptor, which forms a non-covalent complex with a triphosphate anion, and a cell-penetrating agent, which translocates the complex across the plasma membrane. NTP is then released from the complex in the intracellular milieu and accumulates in nuclei and nucleoli in high concentration. The transport of NTPs proceeds rapidly (seconds to minutes) and selectively even in the presence of other organic anions. We demonstrate that this operationally simple and efficient means of transport of fluorescently labelled NTPs into cells can be used for metabolic labeling of DNA in live cells.",10401.0,"Zawada, Zbigniew:Tatar, Ameneh:Mocilac, Pavle:Buděšínský, Miloš:Kraus, Tomáš",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"An International Collaborative Consensus Statement on En Bloc Resection of Bladder Tumour Incorporating Two Systematic Reviews, a Two-round Delphi Survey, and a Consensus Meeting","Background: There has been increasing interest in en bloc resection of bladder tumour (ERBT) as an oncologically noninferior alternative to transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) with fewer complications and better histology specimens. However, there is a lack of robust randomised controlled trial (RCT) data for making recommendations. Objective: We aimed to develop a consensus statement to standardise various aspects of ERBT for clinical practice and to guide future research. Design, setting, and participants: We developed the consensus statement on ERBT using a modified Delphi method. First, two systematic reviews were performed to investigate the clinical effectiveness of ERBT versus TURBT (effectiveness review) and to identify areas of uncertainty in ERBT (uncertainties review). Next, 200 health care professionals (urologists, oncologists, and pathologists) with experience in ERBT were invited to complete a two-round Delphi survey. Finally, a 16-member consensus panel meeting was held to review, discuss, and re-vote on the statements as appropriate. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Meta-analyses were performed for RCT data in the effectiveness review. Consensus statements were developed from the uncertainties review. Consensus was defined as follows: (1) &gt,=70% scoring a statement 7-9 and &lt,=15% scoring the statement 1-3 (consensus agree), or (2) &gt,=70% scoring a statement 1-3 and &lt,=15% scoring the statement 7-9 (consensus disagree). Results and limitations: A total of 10 RCTs were identified upon systematic review. ERBT had a shorter irrigation time (mean difference -7.24 h, 95% confidence interval [CI] -9.29 to -5.20, I2 = 85%, p &lt, 0.001) and a lower rate of bladder perforation (risk ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.83, I2 = 1%, p = 0.02) than TURBT, both with moderate certainty of evidence. There were no significant differences in recurrences at 0-12, 13-24, or 25-36 mo (all very low certainty of evidence). A total of 103 statements were developed, of which 99 reached a consensus. A summary of statements is as follows: ERBT should always be considered for treating non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, ERBT should be considered feasible even for bladder tumours larger than 3 cm, number and location of bladder tumours are not major limitations in performing ERBT, the planned circumferential margin should be at least 5 mm from any visible bladder tumour, after ERBT, additional biopsy of the tumour edge or tumour base should not be performed routinely, for the ERBT specimen, T1 substage, and circumferential and deep resection margins must be assessed, it is safe to give a single dose of immediate intravesical chemotherapy, perform second-look transurethral resection, and give intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy after ERBT, and in studies of ERBT, both per-patient and -tumour analysis should be performed for different outcomes as appropriate. Important outcomes for future ERBT studies were also identified. A limitation is that as consensus statements are brief, concise and binary in nature, areas of uncertainty that are complex in nature may not be addressed adequately. Conclusions: We have provided the most comprehensive review of the evidence base to date using a meta-analysis where appropriate and applying the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and mobilised the international urology community to develop a consensus statement on ERBT using transparent and robust methods. The consensus statement will provide interim guidance for health care professionals who practice ERBT and inform researchers regarding ERBT-related studies in the future. Patient summary: En bloc resection of bladder tumour (ERBT) is a surgical technique aiming to resect a bladder tumour in one piece. We included an international panel of experts to agree on the best practice of ERBT, and this will provide guidance to clinicians and researchers in the future.

Limited capacity of tree growth to mitigate the global greenhouse effect under predicted warming,"It is generally accepted that animal heartbeat and lifespan are often inversely correlated, however, the relationship between productivity and longevity has not yet been described for trees growing under industrial and pre-industrial climates. Using 1768 annually resolved and absolutely dated ring width measurement series from living and dead conifers that grew in undisturbed, high-elevation sites in the Spanish Pyrenees and the Russian Altai over the past 2000 years, we test the hypothesis of grow fast-die young. We find maximum tree ages are significantly correlated with slow juvenile growth rates.

Evaluation of von Willebrand factor with a fully magnetically levitated centrifugal continuous-flow left ventricular assist device in advanced heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Contemporary continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) are associated with degradation of von Willebrand factor (vWF) high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs), a critical factor supporting platelet function. We hypothesized that the HeartMate 3 fully magnetically levitated LVAD, designed to reduce circulatory shear stress, favorably influences these hemostatic parameters. METHODS: Fifteen consecutive HeartMate 3 LVAD patients were compared with 11 consecutive HeartMate II controls. Serial plasma samples were collected pre-implant and on Days 2, 7, 30 and 45 post operatively. Changes in vWF HMWMs were evaluated by 2 independent, study-blind hematologists and confirmed using densitometry-based computerized software. Ristocetin cofactor (RiCO) and vWF antigen (vWF Ag) were measured using standard protocols with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: HeartMate 3 patients and HeartMate II controls had a mean age of 67.3 +/- 1.4 and 52.8 +/- 2.5 years, respectively (INTERMACS Profiles 2 to 4 in 93.3% and 91%, respectively). HeartMate 3 group demonstrated a significantly greater preservation of HMWMs compared with the HeartMate II group, with the most prominent decrease occurring by Day 2 post-operatively and sustained through 45 days (71.94% vs 31.16%, p = 0.001). Laboratory values (normalized to baseline) for RiCO activity, vWF Ag and RiCO: vWF Ag ratio remained in the functional range with no statistically significant differences observed between groups. CONCLUSION: The HeartMate 3 LVAD is associated with enhanced hemocompatibility compared with the HeartMate II LVAD, as demonstrated by the improved preservation of vWF HMWMs, In contrast, effects on HMWM degradation appeared to be dissociated from functional attributes. Further confirmation of these findings in randomized clinical trials is warranted.",0.0,"Netuka, Ivan:Kvasnička, Tomáš:Kvasnička, Jan:Hrachovinová, Ingrid:Ivák, Peter:Mareček, František:Bílková, Jana:Malíková, Ivana:Jančová, Michaela:Malý, Jiří:Sood, Poornima:Sundareswaran, Kartik S.:Connors, Jean M.:Mehra, Mandeep R.",The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
European Association of Urology Guidelines on Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (TaT1 and Carcinoma In Situ)-2019 Update,"Context: This overview presents the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), TaT1, and carcinoma in situ (CIS). Objective: To provide practical recommendations on the clinical management of NMIBC with a focus on clinical presentation and recommendations. Evidence acquisition: A broad and comprehensive scoping exercise covering all areas of the NMIBC guidelines has been performed annually since the last published version in 2017. Databases covered by the search included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Previous guidelines were updated, and the level of evidence and grade of recommendation were assigned. Evidence synthesis: Tumours staged as Ta, T1, and/or CIS are grouped under the heading of NMIBC. Diagnosis depends on cystoscopy and histological evaluation of the tissue obtained by transurethral resection (TURB) in papillary tumours or by multiple bladder biopsies in CIS. In papillary lesions, a complete TURB is essential for the patient&apos,s prognosis and correct diagnosis. Where the initial resection is incomplete, where there is no muscle in the specimen, or where a T1 tumour is detected, a second TURB should be performed within 2-6 wk. The risks of both recurrence and progression may be estimated for individual patients using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scoring system. Stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups is pivotal to the recommendation of adjuvant treatment. In patients with tumours presumed to be at a low risk and in those presumed to be at an intermediate risk with a low previous recurrence rate and an expected EORTC recurrence score of &lt,5, one immediate chemotherapy instillation is recommended. Patients with intermediate-risk tumours should receive 1 yr of full-dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy or instillations of chemotherapy for a maximum of 1 yr. In patients with high-risk tumours, full-dose intravesical BCG for 1-3 yr is indicated. In patients at the highest risk of tumour progression, immediate radical cystectomy should be considered. Cystectomy is recommended in BCG-unresponsive tumours. The extended version of the guidelines is available at the EAU website: https://uroweb.org/guideline/non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/. Conclusions: These abridged EAU guidelines present updated information on the diagnosis and treatment of NMIBC for incorporation into clinical practice. Patient summary: The European Association of Urology Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) Panel has released an updated version of their guidelines, which contains information on classification, risk factors, diagnosis, prognostic factors, and treatment of NMIBC. The recommendations are based on the current literature (until the end of 2018), with emphasis on high-level data from randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses. Stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups is essential for deciding appropriate use of adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillations. Surgical removal of the bladder should be considered in case of BCG-unresponsive tumours or in NMIBCs with the highest risk of progression.",30217.0,"Babjuk, Marek:Burger, Maximilian:Comperat, Eva M.:Gontero, Paolo:Mostafid, A.

Distinct roles of adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase in the catabolism of triacylglycerol estolides,"Branched esters of palmitic acid and hydroxy stearic acid are antiinflammatory and antidiabetic lipokines that belong to a family of fatty acid (FA) esters of hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs) called FAHFAs. FAHFAs themselves belong to oligomeric FA esters, known as estolides. Glycerol-bound FAHFAs in triacylglycerols (TAGs), named TAG estolides, serve as metabolite reservoir of FAHFAs mobilized by lipases upon demand. Here, we characterized the involvement of two major metabolic lipases, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), in TAG estolide and FAHFA degradation. We synthesized a library of 20 TAG estolide isomers with FAHFAs varying in branching position, chain length, saturation grade, and position on the glycerol backbone and developed an in silico mass spectra library of all predicted catabolic intermediates. We found that ATGL alone or coactivated by comparative gene identification-58 efficiently liberated FAHFAs from TAG estolides with a preference for more compact substrates where the estolide branching point is located near the glycerol ester bond. ATGL was further involved in transesterification and remodeling reactions leading to the formation of TAG estolides with alternative acyl compositions. HSL represented a much more potent estolide bond hydrolase for both TAG estolides and free FAHFAs. FAHFA and TAG estolide accumulation in white adipose tissue of mice lacking HSL argued for a functional role of HSL in estolide catabolism in vivo. Our data show that ATGL and HSL participate in the metabolism of estolides and TAG estolides in distinct manners and are likely to affect the lipokine function of FAHFAs.",10608.0,"Brejchová, Kristýna:Radner, F.

Weak effects of geolocators on small birds: a meta-analysis controlled for phylogeny and publication bias,"Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass <100 g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.",10613.0,"Brlík, Vojtěch:Koleček, Jaroslav:Burgess, M.:Hahn, S.:Humple, D.:Krist, M.:Ouwehand, J.:Weiser, E.

Extremely rapid isotropic irradiation of nanoparticles with ions generated in situ by a nuclear reaction,"Energetic ions represent an important tool for the creation of controlled structural defects in solid nanomaterials. However, the current preparative irradiation techniques in accelerators show significant limitations in scaling-up, because only very thin layers of nanoparticles can be efficiently and homogeneously irradiated. Here, we show an easily scalable method for rapid irradiation of nanomaterials by light ions formed homogeneously in situ by a nuclear reaction. The target nanoparticles are embedded in B2O3 and placed in a neutron flux. Neutrons captured by B-10 generate an isotropic flux of energetic a particles and Li-7(+) ions that uniformly irradiates the surrounding nanoparticles. We produced 70 g of fluorescent nanodiamonds in an approximately 30-minute irradiation session, as well as fluorescent silicon carbide nanoparticles. Our method thus increased current preparative yields by a factor of 10(2)-10(3).

Biomolecular charges influence the response of surface plasmon resonance biosensors through electronic and ionic mechanisms,"Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors have become an important label-free optical biomolecular sensing technology and a 'gold standard' for retrieving information on the kinetics of biomolecular interactions. Even though biomolecules typically contain an abundance of easily ionizable chemical groups, there is a gap in understanding of whether (and how) the electrostatic charge of a biomolecular system influences the SPR biosensor response. In this work we show that negative static charge present in a biomolecular layer on the surface of an SPR sensor results in significant SPR spectral shifts, and we identify two major mechanisms responsible for such shifts: 1) the formation of an electrical double layer (ionic mechanism), and 2) changes in the electron density at the surface of a metal (electronic mechanism). We show that under low ionic strength conditions, the electronic mechanism is dominant and the SPR wavelength shift is linearly proportional to the surface concentration of biomolecular charges. At high ionic strength conditions, both electric and ionic mechanisms contribute to the SPR wavelength shift. Using the electronic mechanism, we estimated the pKa of surface-bound carboxylic groups and the relative concentration of the carboxyl-terminated alkanethiols in a binary self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiols. The reported sensitivity of SPR to surface charge is especially important in the context of biomolecular sensing. Moreover, it provides an avenue for the application of SPR sensors for fast, label-free determination of the net charge of a biomolecular coating, which is of interest in material science, surface chemistry, electrochemistry, and other fields.",10306.0,"Šípová, Hana:Jurgová, Ludmila:Mrkvová, Kateřina:Lynn, Nicholas Scott:Špačková, Barbora:Homola, Jiří",Biosensors and Bioelectronics,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Active farmsteads are year-round strongholds for farmland birds,"Farmland birds have experienced substantial declines over recent decades and various conservation measures have been designed to halt their massive decrease. The effectiveness of these measures is however limited, due to inappropriate identification of crucial breeding and wintering habitats. Identification of appropriate habitats, like farmsteads, and understanding seasonal changes in species richness and abundance of farmland birds within these habitats may therefore be key for farmland bird conservation.nnWe investigated the effect of variation in farmstead management on alpha and gamma diversity of all farmland birds and red-listed farmland birds in the Czech Republic. In particular, we evaluated the diversity of wintering and breeding birds at over 200 sites to explore: i) differences in bird communities in three types of farmsteads and open farmland, ii) changes in species-specific habitat preferences between winter and spring, iii) effect of landscape composition, ruderal vegetation and altitude on bird assemblages.nnFarmsteads with animal production harboured the highest, whereas open farmland areas had the lowest, species richness and abundance of all farmland birds and red-listed farmland birds. The decline of species richness in winter was more pronounced in farmland and abandoned farmsteads compared to farmsteads with plant and animal production.nnSingle bird species showed different habitat preferences but the majority of species including red-listed farmland birds changed preferences toward animal farmsteads during winter. Bird species richness was negatively correlated with altitude and positively with representation of ruderal vegetation. Rarefied gamma diversity confirmed local patterns for both all species and red-listed species: the highest total species richness was observed in active animal farmsteads but differences among types were significant only during winter.nn",10619.0,"Šálek, Martin:Bažant, M.:Żmihorski, M.",Journal of Applied Ecology,1,high,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Current European flood-rich period exceptional compared with past 500 years,"There are concerns that recent climate change is altering the frequency and magnitude of river floods in an unprecedented way(1). Historical studies have identified flood-rich periods in the past half millennium in various regions of Europe(2). However, because of the low temporal resolution of existing datasets and the relatively low number of series, it has remained unclear whether Europe is currently in a flood-rich period from a long-term perspective. Here we analyse how recent decades compare with the flood history of Europe, using a new database composed of more than 100 high-resolution (sub-annual) historical flood series based on documentary evidence covering all major regions of Europe. We show that the past three decades were among the most flood-rich periods in Europe in the past 500 years, and that this period differs from other flood-rich periods in terms of its extent, air temperatures and flood seasonality. We identified nine flood-rich periods and associated regions. Among the periods richest in floods are 1560-1580 (western and central Europe), 1760-1800 (most of Europe), 1840-1870 (western and southern Europe) and 1990-2016 (western and central Europe). In most parts of Europe, previous flood-rich periods occurred during cooler-than-usual phases, but the current flood-rich period has been much warmer. Flood seasonality is also more pronounced in the recent period. For example, during previous flood and interflood periods, 41 per cent and 42 per cent of central European floods occurred in summer, respectively, compared with 55 per cent of floods in the recent period. The exceptional nature of the present-day flood-rich period calls for process-based tools for flood-risk assessment that capture the physical mechanisms involved, and management strategies that can incorporate the recent changes in risk.",10509.0,"Bloeschl, G.:Kiss, A.:Viglione, A.:Barriendos, M.:Böhm, O.:Brázdil, Rudolf:Coeur, D.:Demaree, G.:Llasat, M.

Phase-plate cryo-EM structure of the Widom 601 CENP-A nucleosome core particle reveals differential flexibility of the DNA ends,"The histone H3 variant CENP-A marks centromeres epigenetically and is essential for mitotic fidelity. Previous crystallographic studies of the CENP-A nucleosome core particle (NCP) reconstituted with a human alpha-satellite DNA derivative revealed both DNA ends to be highly flexible, a feature important for CENP-A mitotic functions. However, recent cryo-EM studies of CENP-A NCP complexes comprising primarily Widom 601 DNA reported well-ordered DNA ends. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the CENP-A 601 NCP determined by Volta phase-plate imaging. The data reveal that one (&apos,left&apos,) 601 DNA end is well ordered whereas the other (&apos,right&apos,) end is flexible and partly detached from the histone core, suggesting sequence-dependent dynamics of the DNA termini. Indeed, a molecular dynamics simulation of the CENP-A 601 NCP confirmed the distinct dynamics of the two DNA extremities. Reprocessing the image data using two-fold symmetry yielded a cryo-EM map in which both DNA ends appeared well ordered, indicating that such an artefact may inadvertently arise if NCP asymmetry is lost during image processing. These findings enhance our understanding of the dynamic features that discriminate CENP-A from H3 nucleosomes by revealing that DNA end flexibility can be fine-tuned in a sequence-dependent manner.",10600.0,"Boopathi, Ramachandran:Danev, Radostin:Khoshouei, Maryam:Kale, Seyit:Nahata, Sunil:Ramos, Lorrie:Angelov, Dimitar:Dimitrov, Stefan:Hamiche, Ali:Petosa, Carlo:Bednár, Jan",Nucleic Acids Research,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Direct measurement of the muonic content of extensive air showers between 2 × 1017 and 2 × 1018 eV at the Pierre Auger Observatory,"The hybrid design of the Pierre Auger Observatory allows for the measurement of the properties of extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays with unprecedented precision. By using an array of prototype underground muon detectors, we have performed the first direct measurement, by the Auger Collaboration, of the muon content of air showers between 2x1017 and 2x1018 eV. We have studied the energy evolution of the attenuation-corrected muon density, and compared it to predictions from air shower simulations. The observed densities are found to be larger than those predicted by models. We quantify this discrepancy by combining the measurements from the muon detector with those from the Auger fluorescence detector at 1017.5 eV and 1018 eV. We find that, for the models to explain the data, an increase in the muon density of 38%+/- 4%(12%)+/- 18%21% for EPOS-LHC, and of 50%(53%)+/- 4%(13%)+/- 20%23% for QGSJetII-04, is respectively needed.n",10303.0,"Aab, A.:Abreu, A.:Aglietta, M.:Bakalová, Alena:Blažek, Jiří:Boháčová, Martina:Chudoba, Jiří:Ebr, Jan:Juryšek, Jakub:Mandát, Dušan:Palatka, Miroslav:Pech, Miroslav:Prouza, Michael:Řídký, Jan:dos Santos, Eva M.

Dinucleoside polyphosphates act as 5′-RNA caps in bacteria,"It has been more than 50 years since the discovery of dinucleoside polyphosphates (NpnNs) and yet their roles and mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here, we show that both methylated and non-methylated NpnNs serve as RNA caps in Escherichia coli. NpnNs are excellent substrates for T7 and E. coli RNA polymerases (RNAPs) and efficiently initiate transcription. We demonstrate, that the E. coli enzymes RNA 5′-pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH) and bis(5′-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (ApaH) are able to remove the NpnN-caps from RNA. ApaH is able to cleave all NpnN-caps, while RppH is unable to cleave the methylated forms suggesting that the methylation adds an additional layer to RNA stability regulation. Our work introduces a different perspective on the chemical structure of RNA in prokaryotes and on the role of RNA caps.

Mutations in ATP1A1 Cause Dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 2,"Although mutations in more than 90 genes are known to cause CMT, the underlying genetic cause of CMT remains unknown in more than 50% of affected individuals. The discovery of additional genes that harbor CMT2-causing mutations increasingly depends on sharing sequence data on a global level. In this way-by combining data from seven countries on four continents-we were able to define mutations in ATP1A1, which encodes the alpha1 subunit of the Na+, K+-ATPase, as a cause of autosomal-dominant CMT2. Seven missense changes were identified that segregated within individual pedigrees: c.143T&gt,G (p.Leu48Arg), c.1775T&gt,C (p.Ile592Thr), c.1789G&gt,A (p.Ala597Thr), c.1801_1802delinsTT (p.Asp601Phe), c.1798C&gt,G (p.Pro600Ala), c.1798C&gt,A (p.Pro600Thr), and c.2432A&gt,C (p.Asp811Ala). Immunostaining peripheral nerve axons localized ATP1A1 to the axolemma of myelinated sensory and motor axons and to Schmidt-Lanterman incisures of myelin sheaths. Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements on Xenopus oocytes demonstrated significant reduction in Na+ current activity in some, but not all, ouabain-insensitive ATP1A1 mutants, suggesting a loss-of-function defect of the Na+, K+ pump. Five mutants fall into a remarkably narrow motif within the helical linker region that couples the nucleotide-binding and phosphorylation domains.

Actor-Critic Off-Policy Learning for Optimal Control of Multiple-Model Discrete-Time Systems,"In this paper, motivated by human neurocognitive experiments, a model-free off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to solve the optimal tracking control of multiple-model linear discrete-time systems. First, an adaptive self-organizing map neural network is used to determine the system behavior from measured data and to assign a responsibility signal to each of system possible behaviors. A new model is added if a sudden change of system behavior is detected from the measured data and the behavior has not been previously detected. A value function is represented by partially weighted value functions. Then, the off-policy iteration algorithm is generalized to multiple-model learning to find a solution without any knowledge about the system dynamics or reference trajectory dynamics. The off-policy approach helps to increase data efficiency and speed of tuning since a stream of experiences obtained from executing a behavior policy is reused to update several value functions corresponding to different learning policies sequentially. Two numerical examples serve as a demonstration of the off-policy algorithm performance.",20205.0,"Škach, Jan:Kiumarsi, Bahare:Lewis, Frank L.:Straka, Ondřej",IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dishevelled-3 conformation dynamics analyzed by FRET-based biosensors reveals a key role of casein kinase 1,"Dishevelled (DVL) is the key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Currently, DVL conformational dynamics under native conditions is unknown. To overcome this limitation, we develop the Fluorescein Arsenical Hairpin Binder- (FlAsH-) based FRET in vivo approach to study DVL conformation in living cells. Using this single-cell FRET approach, we demonstrate that (i) Wnt ligands induce open DVL conformation, (ii) DVL variants that are predominantly open, show more even subcellular localization and more efficient membrane recruitment by Frizzled (FZD) and (iii) Casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1 epsilon) has a key regulatory function in DVL conformational dynamics. In silico modeling and in vitro biophysical methods explain how CK1 epsilon-specific phosphorylation events control DVL conformations via modulation of the PDZ domain and its interaction with DVL C-terminus.

Intact Cell Mass Spectrometry as a Quality Control Tool for Revealing Minute Phenotypic Changes of Cultured Human Embryonic Stem Cells,"The stability of in vitro cell cultures is an important issue for any clinical, bio-industrial, or pharmacological use. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, consequently, they possess the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers and are inherently prone to respond to differentiation stimuli. However, long-term culture inevitably yields clones that are best adapted to the culture conditions, passaging regimes, or differentiation sensitivity. This cellular plasticity is a major obstacle in the development of bio-industrial or clinical-grade cultures. At present, the quality control of cell cultures is limited by the lack of reliable (epi)genetic or molecular markers or by the focus on a particular type of instability such as karyotype abnormalities or adverse phenotypic traits. Therefore, there is an ongoing need for robust, feasible, and sensitive methods of determining or confirming cell status and for revealing potential divergences from the optimal state. We modeled both intrinsic and extrinsic changes in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) states using different experimental strategies and addressed the changes in cell status by intact cell mass spectrometry fingerprinting.

Does First-Trimester Screening Modify the Natural History of Congenital Heart Disease? Analysis of Outcome of Regional Cardiac Screening at 2 Different Time Periods,"BACKGROUND: The study analyzed the impact of first-trimester screening on the spectrum of congenital heart defects (CHDs) later in pregnancy and on the outcome of fetuses and children born alive with a CHD. METHODS: The spectrum of CHDs, associated comorbidities, and outcome of fetuses, either diagnosed with a CHD in the first trimester (Group I, 127 fetuses) or only in the second-trimester screening (Group II, 344 fetuses), were analyzed retrospectively between 2007 and 2013. Second-trimester fetuses diagnosed with a CHD between 2007 and 2013 were also compared with Group III (532 fetuses diagnosed with a CHD in the second trimester from 1996 to 2001, the period before first-trimester screening was introduced). RESULTS: The spectrum of CHDs diagnosed in the first and second trimesters in the same time period differed significantly, with a greater number of comorbidities (P&lt, 0.0001), CHDs with univentricular outcome (P&lt, 0.0001), intrauterine deaths (P= 0.01), and terminations of pregnancy (P&lt, 0.0001) in Group I compared with Group II. In Group III, significantly more cases of CHDs with univentricular outcome (P&lt, 0.0001), intrauterine demise (P= 0.036), and early termination (P&lt, 0.0001) were identified compared with fetuses diagnosed with CHDs in the second trimester between 2007 and 2013. The spectrum of CHDs seen in the second-trimester groups differed after first-trimester screening was implemented. CONCLUSIONS: First-trimester screening had a significant impact on the spectrum of CHDs and the outcomes of pregnancies with CHDs diagnosed in the second trimester. Early detection of severe forms of CHDs and significant comorbidities resulted in an increased pregnancy termination rate in the first trimester.",30201.0,"Jičínská, Hana:Vlasin, Pavel:Jicinsky, Michal:Grochová, Ilga:Tomek, Viktor:Volaufova, Julia:Skovranek, Jan:Marek, Jan",Circulation,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Party nomination strategies in flexible-list systems : Do preference votes matter?,"A paradox in the comparative literature on electoral systems is that one of the most common systems in Europe – flexible-list proportional representation systems – may be the least understood. Any study of flexible-list systems must start by acknowledging a puzzle: why candidates spend time and effort striving to win preference votes when typically these votes make no difference between election and defeat. Offering the first comprehensive multi-country test of this key puzzle, we provide evidence from Belgium, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia that parties will promote to better list ranks in the next election those candidates who are successful at winning preference votes, thereby improving their prospects of election in the longer term and incentivizing them to cultivate personal reputations.

"Optical Trapping, Optical Binding, and Rotational Dynamics of Silicon Nanowires in Counter-Propagating Beams","Silicon nanowires are held and manipulated in controlled optical traps based on counter-propagating beams focused by low numerical aperture lenses. The double-beam configuration compensates light scattering forces enabling an in-depth investigation of the rich dynamics of trapped nanowires that are prone to both optical and hydrodynamic interactions. Several polarization configurations are used, allowing the observation of optical binding with different stable structure as well as the transfer of spin and orbital momentum of light to the trapped silicon nanowires. Accurate modeling based on Brownian dynamics simulations with appropriate optical and hydrodynamic coupling confirms that this rich scenario is crucially dependent on the non-spherical shape of the nanowires.

Room temperature organic magnets derived from sp(3) functionalized graphene,"Materials based on metallic elements that have d orbitals and exhibit room temperature magnetism have been known for centuries and applied in a huge range of technologies. Development of room temperature carbon magnets containing exclusively sp orbitals is viewed as great challenge in chemistry, physics, spintronics and materials science. Here we describe a series of room temperature organic magnets prepared by a simple and controllable route based on the substitution of fluorine atoms in fluorographene with hydroxyl groups. Depending on the chemical composition (an F/OH ratio) and sp(3) coverage, these new graphene derivatives show room temperature antiferromagnetic ordering, which has never been observed for any sp-based materials. Such 2D magnets undergo a transition to a ferromagnetic state at low temperatures, showing an extraordinarily high magnetic moment.

A special software, able to fit even the overlapping spectra, was developed to batch process the massive datasets produced by this spatio-temporal study.

Discovery of rapid whistlers close to Jupiter implying lightning rates similar to those on Earth,"Electrical currents in atmospheric lightning strokes generate impulsive radio waves in a broad range of frequencies, called atmospherics. These waves can be modified by their passage through the plasma environment of a planet into the form of dispersed whistlers1. In the Io plasma torus around Jupiter, Voyager 1 detected whistlers as several-seconds-long slowly falling tones at audible frequencies. These measurements were the first evidence of lightning at Jupiter. Subsequently, Jovian lightning was observed by optical cameras on board several spacecraft in the form of localized flashes of light. Here, we show measurements by the Waves instrument on board the Juno spacecraft that indicate observations of Jovian rapid whistlers: a form of dispersed atmospherics at extremely short timescales of several milliseconds to several tens of milliseconds. On the basis of these measurements, we report over 1,600 lightning detections, the largest set obtained to date. The data were acquired during close approaches to Jupiter between August 2016 and September 2017, at radial distances below 5 Jovian radii. We detected up to four lightning strokes per second, similar to rates in thunderstorms on Earth and six times the peak rates from the Voyager 1 observations.",10305.0,"Kolmašová, Ivana:Imai, M.:Santolík, Ondřej:Kurth, W.

"High-temperature overprint in (U)HPM rocks exhumed from subduction zones, A product of isothermal decompression or a consequence of slab break-off (slab rollback)?","This paper presents and discusses petrological observations from high- to ultrahigh-pressure (U)HP metamorphic terrains in relation to existing geophysical and numerical models for subduction and exhumation processes in orogenic belts. The interpretations are mostly based on observations from gneiss terrains bearing abundant bodies mafic (meta-)eclogite and ultramafic garnet peridotite and pyroxenite, exposed in collisional orogens. The inclusions and compositional zoning of minerals are considered to be first order information that is needed to constrain PT paths of HP-UHP rocks and reconstruct the related geodynamic models for subduction and exhumation of crustal and mantle rocks. The Bohemian Massif of the European Variscides is used as the basis for a model example to explain these processes, but (U)HP rocks from various other terrains are taken into consideration to discuss available PT paths in relation to proposed subduction and exhumation rates of (U)HP rocks based on geophysical and geochronological data. Primarily information used in this respect include textural relations and preserved prograde zoning in minerals from many (U)HP rocks, which reveal that a relatively cool geothermal gradient typical of subduction zones tended to prevail during the prograde and peak pressure segments of PT paths prior to initiation of exhumation and may have continued, even with cooling, if exhumation rates were rapid. The commonly applied interpretation of isothermal decompression during exhumation is critically appraised, considering whether a simple thermal relaxation (and radiogenic heating) during exhumation is responsible for formation of post-peak pressure, retrograde mineral assemblages and textures observed in (U)HP rocks. We go on to consider whether this can satisfactorily explain the often pervasive mediumpressure, high-temperature metamorphic re-equilibration of (U)HP rocks or whether an additional, external source of heat is a better explanation. We conclude that the commonly observed high-temperature metamorphic overprint exhibited by (U)HP rocks occurs mostly after rocks have been exhumed from the subduction channel and have reached normal crustal positions, when mantle upwelling resulting from slab breakoff (delamination) or slab rollback takes place at the onset of continent-continent collision. We also explore contrasting PT trajectories for mantle rocks that have been entrained into crustal material during their subduction or exhumation, PT paths of mantle and subducted crustal rocks tend to converge as mantle rocks impinge upon the cooler subduction zone and, once entrained, share a common evolution that depends on the exhumation mechanism and rate. Considering all of the data presented in this work we conclude that the diverse, polyphase metamorphic evolution exhibited by (U)HP terrains, embodied in the PT paths of HP and UHP rocks, has important consequences for reconstructing their changing thermal regimes and provides important constraints for geodynamic models involving subduction and the transition to collision.",10505.0,"Faryad, Shah Wali:Cuthbert, S.

Nanocrystals for dermal penetration enhancement - Effect of concentration and underlying mechanisms using curcumin as model,"Nanocrystals have received considerable attention in dermal application due to their ability to enhance delivery to the skin and overcome bioavailability issues caused by poor water and oil drug solubility. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of nanocrystals on the mechanism of penetration behavior of curcumin as a model drug. Curcumin nanocrystals were produced by the smartCrystals? process, i.e. bead milling followed by high pressure homogenization. The mean particle size of the curcumin crystals was about 200 nm. Stabilization was performed with alkyl polyglycoside surfactants. The distribution of curcumin within the skin was determined in vitro on cross-sections of porcine skin and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. The skin penetration profile was analyzed for the curcumin nanosuspension with decreasing concentrations (2%, 0.2%, 0.02% and 0.002% by weight) and compared to nanocrystals in a viscous hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) gel. This study demonstrated there was minor difference between low viscous nanosuspension and the gel, but low viscosity seemed to favor skin penetration. Localization of curcumin was observed in the hair follicles, also contributing to skin uptake. Looking at the penetration of curcumin from formulations with decreasing nanocrystal concentration, formulations with 2%, 0.2% and 0.02% showed a similar penetration profile, whereas a significantly weaker fluorescence was observed in the case of a formulation containing 0.002% of curcumin nanocrystals.",0.0,"Vidlářová, Lucie:Romero, G.B.:Hanuš, Jaroslav:Štěpánek, František:Müller, R.H.",European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics,1,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
XRCC1 prevents toxic PARP1 trapping during DNA base excision repair,"Mammalian DNA base excision repair (BER) is accelerated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and the scaffold protein XRCC1. PARPs are sensors that detect single-strand break intermediates, but the critical role of XRCC1 during BER is unknown. Here, we show that protein complexes containing DNA polymerase beta and DNA ligase III that are assembled by XRCC1 prevent excessive engagement and activity of PARP1 during BER. As a result, PARP1 becomes ´trapped´ on BER intermediates in XRCC1-deficient cells in a manner similar to that induced by PARP inhibitors, including in patient fibroblasts from XRCC1-mutated disease. This excessive PARP1 engagement and trapping renders BER intermediates inaccessible to enzymes such as DNA polymerase beta and impedes their repair. Consequently, PARP1 deletion rescues BER and resistance to base damage in XRCC1(-/-) cells. These data reveal excessive PARP1 engagement during BER as a threat to genome integrity and identify XRCC1 as an ´anti-trapper´ that prevents toxic PARP1 activity.",10608.0,"Demin, A.A.:Hirota, K.:Tsuda, M.:Adamowicz, M.:Hailstone, R.:Brazina, J.:Gittens, W.:Kalasová, Ilona:Shao, Z.:Zha, S.:Sasanuma, H.:Hanzlíková, Hana:Takeda, S.:Caldecott, Keith",Molecular Cell,1,high,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Physical Orienteering Problem for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Data Collection Planning in Environments with Obstacles,"This paper concerns a variant of the Orienteering Problem (OP) that arises from multi-goal data collection scenarios where a robot with a limited travel budget is requested to visit given target locations in an environment with obstacles. We call the introduced OP variant the Physical Orienteering Problem (POP). The POP sets out to determine a feasible, collision-free, path that maximizes collected reward from a subset of the target locations and does not exceed the given travel budget. The problem combines motion planning and combinatorial optimization to visit multiple target locations. The proposed solution to the POP is based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) method combined with the asymptotically optimal sampling-based Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM*) method. The VNS-PRM* uses initial low-dense roadmap that is continuously expanded during the VNS-based POP optimization to shorten paths of the promising solutions, and thus allows maximizing the sum of the collected rewards. The computational results support the feasibility of the proposed approach by a fast determination of high-quality solutions. Moreover, an experimental verification demonstrates the applicability of the proposed VNS-PRM* approach for data collection planning for an unmanned aerial vehicle in an urban-like environment with obstacles.",10201.0,"Pěnička, Robert:Faigl, Jan:Saska, Martin",IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Gene fragmentation and RNA editing without borders: eccentric mitochondrial genomes of diplonemids,"Diplonemids are highly abundant heterotrophic marine protists. Previous studies showed that their strikingly bloated mitochondrial genome is unique because of systematic gene fragmentation and manifold RNA editing. Here we report a comparative study of mitochondrial genome architecture, gene structure and RNA editing of six recently isolated, phylogenetically diverse diplonemid species. Mitochondria) gene fragmentation and modes of RNA editing, which include cytidine-to-uridine (C-to-U) and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) substitutions and 3' uridine additions (U-appendage), are conserved across diplonemids. Yet as we show here, all these features have been pushed to their extremes in the Hemistasiidae lineage. For example, Namystynia karyoxenos has its genes fragmented into more than twice as many modules than other diplonemids, with modules as short as four nucleotides. Furthermore, we detected in this group multiple A-appendage and guanosine-to-adenosine (G-to-A) substitution editing events not observed before in diplonemids and found very rarely elsewhere. With >1,000 sites, C-to-U and A-to-I editing in Namystynia is nearly 10 times more frequent than in other diplonemids. The editing density of 12% in coding regions makes Namystynia's the most extensively edited transcriptome described so far.

We theoretically analyze the variance of the optimal MIS weights and show the relation to the variance of the balance heuristic.

Standardized flow cytometry for highly sensitive MRD measurements in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"A fully-standardized EuroFlow 8-color antibody panel and laboratory procedure was stepwise designed to measure minimal residual disease (MRD) in B-cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with a sensitivity of &lt,= 10(-25), comparable to real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)-based MRD detection via antigen-receptor rearrangements. Leukocyte markers and the corresponding antibodies and fluorochromes were selected based on their contribution in separating BCP-ALL cells from normal/regenerating BCP cells in multidimensional principal component analyses. After 5 multicenter design-test-evaluate-redesign phases with a total of 319 BCP-ALL patients at diagnosis, two 8-color antibody tubes were selected, which allowed separation between normal and malignant BCP cells in 99% of studied patients. These 2 tubes were tested with a new erythrocyte bulk-lysis protocol allowing acquisition of high cell numbers in 377 bone marrow follow-up samples of 178 BCP-ALL patients. Comparison with RQ-PCR-based MRD data showed a clear positive relation between the percentage concordant cases and the number of cells acquired. For those samples with &gt, 4 million cells acquired, concordant results were obtained in 93% of samples. Most discordances were clarified upon high-throughput sequencing of antigen-receptor rearrangements and blind multicenter reanalysis of flow cytometric data, resulting in an unprecedented concordance of 98% (97% for samples withMRD &lt, 0.01%). In conclusion, the fully standardized EuroFlow BCP-ALLMRD strategy is applicable in &gt, 98% of patients with sensitivities at least similar toRQ-PCR (&lt,= 10(-25)), if sufficient cells (&gt, 4310 6, preferablymore) are evaluated.",30204.0,"Theunissen, Prisca:Mejstříková, Ester:Sedek, Lukasz:van der Sluijs-Gelling, Alita J.:Gaipa, Giuseppe:Bartels, Marius:da Costa, Elaine Sobral:Kotrová, Michaela:Nováková, Michaela:Sonneveld, Edwin:Buracchi, Chiara:Bonaccorso, Paola:Oliveira, Elen:te Marvelde, Jeroen G.:Szczepanski, Tomasz:Lhermitte, Ludovic:Hrušák, Ondřej:Lecrevisse, Quentin:Emilia Grigore, Georgiana:Froňková, Eva:Trka, Jan:Brueggemann, Monika:Orfao, Alberto:van Dongen, Jacques J.

A rationale for early extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with postinfarction ventricular septal rupture complicated by cardiogenic shock,"Aims Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) became a rare mechanical complication of myocardial infarction in the era of percutaneous coronary interventions but is associated with extreme mortality in patients who present with cardiogenic shock (CS). Promising outcomes have been reported with the use of circulatory support allowing haemodynamic stabilization, followed by delayed repair. Therefore, we analysed our experience with an early use of Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (V-A ECMO) for postinfarction VSR. Methods and results We conducted a retrospective search of institutional database for patients presenting with postinfarction VSR from January 2007 to June 2016. Data from 31 consecutive patients (mean age 69.5 +/- 9.1 years) who were admitted to hospital were analysed. Seven out of 31 patients with VSR who were in refractory CS received V-A ECMO support preoperatively. ECMO improved end-organ perfusion with decreased lactate levels 24 hours after implantation (7.9 mmol/L vs. 1.6 mmol/L, p = 0.01), normalized arterial pH (7.25 vs. 7.40, p &lt, 0.04), improved mean arterial pressure (64 mmHg vs. 83 mmHg, p &lt, 0.01) and lowered heart rate (115/min vs. 68/min, p &lt, 0.01). Mean duration of ECMO support was 12 days, 5 out of 7 patients underwent surgical repair, 4 were weaned from ECMO, 3 survived 30 days and 2 survived more than 1 year. The most frequent complication (5 patients) and the cause of death (3 patients) was bleeding. Conclusions Our experience suggests that early V-A ECMO in patients with VSR and refractory CS might prevent irreversible multiorgan failure by improved end-organ perfusion.

Clinical Genetic Testing for Familial Hypercholesterolemia: JACC Scientific Expert Panel,"Although awareness of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is increasing, this common, potentially fatal, treatable condition remains underdiagnosed. Despite FH being a genetic disorder, genetic testing is rarely used. The Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation convened an international expert panel to assess the utility of FH genetic testing. The rationale includes the following: 1) facilitation of definitive diagnosis, 2) pathogenic variants indicate higher cardiovascular risk, which indicates the potential need for more aggressive lipid lowering, 3) increase in initiation of and adherence to therapy, and 4) cascade testing of at-risk relatives. The Expert Consensus Panel recommends that FH genetic testing become the standard of care for patients with definite or probable FH, as well as for their at-risk relatives. Testing should include the genes encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), other genes may also need to be considered for analysis based on patient phenotype.

The synthesis was optimized to afford diastereomeric mixtures of novel prodrugs in one pot (yields up to 86%), and the epimers were resolved using a chiral HPLC column into fast-eluting and slow-eluting epimers. In human lymphocytes, the most efficient tyrosine-based prodrug reached a single-digit picomolar EC50 value against HIV-1 and nearly 300-fold higher selectivity index (SI) compared to TAF. In human hepatocytes, the most efficient prodrugs exhibited subnanomolar EC50 values for HBV and up to 26-fold higher SI compared to TAF. Metabolic studies demonstrated markedly higher cellular uptake of the prodrugs and substantially higher levels of released tenofovir inside the cells compared to TAF.

Calreticulin exposure by malignant blasts correlates with robust anticancer immunity and improved clinical outcome in AML patients,"Cancer cell death can be perceived as immunogenic by the host only when malignant cells emit immunostimulatory signals (so-called ""damage-associated molecular patterns,"" DAMPs), as they die in the context of failing adaptive responses to stress. Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that the capacity of immunogenic cell death to (re-)activate an anticancer immune response is key to the success of various chemo- and radiotherapeutic regimens. Malignant blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exposed multiple DAMPs, including calreticulin (CRT), heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), and HSP90 on their plasma membrane irrespective of treatment. In these patients, high levels of surface-exposed CRT correlated with an increased proportion of natural killer cells and effector memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the periphery. Moreover, CRT exposure on the plasma membrane of malignant blasts positively correlated with the frequency of circulating T cells specific for leukemia-associated antigens, indicating that ecto-CRT favors the initiation of anticancer immunity in patients with AML. Finally, although the levels of ecto-HSP70, ecto-HSP90, and ecto-CRT were all associated with improved relapse-free survival, only CRT exposure significantly correlated with superior overall survival. Thus, CRT exposure represents a novel powerful prognostic biomarker for patients with AML, reflecting the activation of a clinically relevant AML-specific immune response.",0.0,"Fučíková, Jitka:Truxová, Iva:Hensler, Michal:Becht, Etienne:Kašíková, Lenka:Moserová, Irena:Vosahlikova, Sarka:Kloučková, Jana:Church, Sarah E:Cremer, Isabelle:Kepp, Oliver:Kroemer, Guido:Galluzzi, Lorenzo:Šálek, Cyril:Špíšek, Radek",Blood,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0

Repeat-sequence turnover shifts fundamentally in species with large genomes,"Given the 2,400-fold range of genome sizes (0.06-148.9 Gbp (gigabase pair)) of seed plants (angiosperms and gymnosperms) with a broadly similar gene content (amounting to approximately 0.03 Gbp), the repeat-sequence content of the genome might be expected to increase with genome size, resulting in the largest genomes consisting almost entirely of repetitive sequences. Here we test this prediction, using the same bioinformatic approach for 101 species to ensure consistency in what constitutes a repeat. We reveal a fundamental change in repeat turnover in genomes above around 10 Gbp, such that species with the largest genomes are only about 55% repetitive.

"The future distribution of river fish: The complex interplay of climate and land use changes, species dispersal and movement barriers","The future distribution of river fishes will be jointly affected by climate and land use changes forcing species to move in space. However, little is known whether fish species will be able to keep pace with predicted climate and land use-driven habitat shifts, in particular in fragmented river networks. In this study, we coupled species distribution models (stepwise boosted regression trees) of 17 fish species with species-specific models of their dispersal (fish dispersal model FIDIMO) in the European River Elbe catchment. We quantified (i) the extent and direction (up-vs. downstream) of predicted habitat shifts under coupled moderate and severe climate and land use change scenarios for 2050, and (ii) the dispersal abilities of fishes to track predicted habitat shifts while explicitly considering movement barriers (e.g., weirs, dams). Our results revealed median net losses of suitable habitats of 24 and 94 river kilometers per species for the moderate and severe future scenarios, respectively.

Glycemic Outcomes in Adults With T1D Are Impacted More by Continuous Glucose Monitoring Than by Insulin Delivery Method: 3 Years of Follow-Up From the COMISAIR Study,"OBJECTIVE This study assessed the clinical impact of four treatment strategies in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D): real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) with multiple daily insulin injections (rtCGM+MDI), rtCGM with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (rtCGM+CSII), self-monitoring of blood glucose with MDI (SMBG+MDI), and SMBG with CSII (SMBG+CSII). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This 3-year, nonrandomized, prospective, real-world, clinical trial followed 94 participants with T1D (rtCGM+MDI, n = 22, rtCGM+CSII, n = 26, SMBG+MDI, n = 21, SMBG+CSII, n = 25). The main end points were changes in A1C, time in range (70-180 mg/dL [3.9-10 mmol/L]), time below range (&lt,70 mg/dL [&lt,3.9 mmol/L]), glycemic variability, and incidence of hypoglycemia. RESULTS At 3 years, the rtCGM groups (rtCGM+MDI and rtCGM+CSII) had significantly lower A1C (7.0% [53 mmol/mol], P = 0.0002, and 6.9% [52 mmol/mol], P &lt, 0.0001, respectively), compared with the SMBG+CSII and SMBG+MDI groups (7.7% [61 mmol/mol], P = 0.3574, and 8.0% [64 mmol/mol], P = 1.000, respectively), with no significant difference between the rtCGM groups. Significant improvements in percentage of time in range were observed in the rtCGM subgroups (rtCGM+MDI, 48.7-69.0%, P &lt, 0.0001, and rtCGM+CSII, 50.9-72.3%, P &lt, 0.0001) and in the SMBG+CSII group (50.6-57.8%, P = 0.0114). Significant reductions in time below range were found only in the rtCGM subgroups (rtCGM+MDI, 9.4-5.5%, P = 0.0387, and rtCGM+CSII, 9.0-5.3%, P = 0.0235). Seven severe hypoglycemia episodes occurred: SMBG groups, n = 5, sensor-augmented insulin regimen groups, n = 2. CONCLUSIONS rtCGM was superior to SMBG in reducing A1C, hypoglycemia, and other end points in individuals with T1D regardless of their insulin delivery method. rtCGM+MDI can be considered an equivalent but lower-cost alternative to sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy and superior to treatment with SMBG+MDI or SMBG+CSII therapy.",30202.0,"Šoupal, Jan:Petruželková, Lenka:Grunberger, George:Hásková, Aneta:Flekač, Milan:Matoulek, Martin:Mikeš, Ondřej:Pelcl, Tomáš:Škrha, Jan:Horová, Eva:Škrha, Jan:Parkin, Christopher G:Svačina, Štěpán:Prázný, Martin",Diabetes Care,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Sensory phenotype and risk factors for painful diabetic neuropathy: a cross-sectional observational study,"Different sensory profiles in diabetic distal symmetrical sensory-motor polyneuropathy (DSPN) may be associated with pain and the responsiveness to analgesia. We aimed to characterize sensory phenotypes of patients with painful and painless diabetic neuropathy and to assess demographic, clinical, metabolic, and electrophysiological parameters related to the presence of neuropathic pain in a large cohort of well-defined DSPN subjects. This observational cross-sectional multi-center cohort study (performed as part of the ncRNAPain EU consortium) of 232 subjects with nonpainful (n = 74) and painful (n = 158) DSPN associated with diabetes mellitus of type 1 and 2 (median age 63 years, range 21-87 years, 92 women) comprised detailed history taking, laboratory tests, neurological examination, quantitative sensory testing, nerve conduction studies, and neuropathy severity scores. All parameters were analyzed with regard to the presence and severity of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was positively correlated with the severity of neuropathy and thermal hyposensitivity (P &lt, 0.001). A minority of patients with painful DSPN (14.6%) had a sensory profile, indicating thermal hypersensitivity that was associated with less severe neuropathy. Neuropathic pain was further linked to female sex and higher cognitive appraisal of pain as assessed by the pain catastrophizing scale (P &lt, 0.001), while parameters related to diabetes showed no influence on neuropathic pain with the exception of laboratory signs of nephropathy. This study confirms the value of comprehensive DSPN phenotyping and underlines the importance of the severity of neuropathy for the presence of pain.

Czech 23-month-olds use gender agreement to anticipate upcoming nouns,"Children acquiring Dutch, French, and Spanish can use gender of articles to facilitate the processing of upcoming nouns. The current study examined whether a similar effect can be found for bound gender-marking agreement morphemes in Czech, a language without obligatory articles. The experiment was designed so that the anticipatory effects of gender-marking morphemes before the head noun onset could be observed. In a preferential looking experiment, 33 children (aged 21–24 months) were shown picture pairs that could be labeled with masculine and feminine nouns. They heard a phrase comprising a demonstrative, an adjective, and a noun, where the first two elements were inflected for gender. The inflections were either correct (matching the noun gender) or incorrect (mismatched). Children were also given offline receptive grammar and vocabulary tasks. The group of children as a whole did not show significant differences in looking behavior between the experimental conditions. When split by the grammar task, the high-scoring children showed significant differences between looks toward the target noun in the matched and mismatched conditions even before the onset of the target noun. No significant difference was observed in the low-scoring group and in the groups split by vocabulary.

Acquisition of exogenous haem is essential for tick reproduction,"Haem and iron homeostasis in most eukaryotic cells is based on a balanced flux between haem biosynthesis and haem oxygenase-mediated degradation. Unlike most eukaryotes, ticks possess an incomplete haem biosynthetic pathway and, together with other (non-haematophagous) mites, lack a gene encoding haem oxygenase. We demonstrated, by membrane feeding, that ticks do not acquire bioavailable iron from haemoglobin-derived haem. However, ticks require dietary haemoglobin as an exogenous source of haem since, feeding with haemoglobin-depleted serum led to aborted embryogenesis. Supplementation of serum with haemoglobin fully restored egg fertility. Surprisingly, haemoglobin could be completely substituted by serum proteins for the provision of amino-acids in vitellogenesis. Acquired haem is distributed by haemolymph carrier protein(s) and sequestered by vitellins in the developing oocytes.

Resolving the taxonomy of emerging zoonotic pathogens in the Trichophyton benhamiae complex,"Species of the Trichophyton benhamiae complex are predominantly zoophilic pathogens with a worldwide distribution. These pathogens have recently become important due to their epidemic spread in pets and pet owners. Considerable genetic and phenotypic variability has been revealed in these emerging pathogens, but the species limits and host spectra have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we used an approach combining phylogenetic analysis based on four loci, population-genetic data, phenotypic and physiological analysis, mating type gene characterization and ecological data to resolve the taxonomy of these pathogens. This approach supported the inclusion of nine taxa in the complex, including three new species and one new variety. Trichophyton benhamiae var. luteum var. nov. (&quot,yellow phenotype&quot, strains) is currently a major cause of zoonotic tinea corporis and capitis in Europe (mostly transmitted from guinea pigs). The isolates of the &quot,white phenotype&quot, do not form a monophyletic group and are segregated into three taxa, T. benhamiae var. benhamiae (mostly North America, dogs), T. europaeum sp. nov. (mostly Europe, guinea pigs), and T. japonicum sp. nov. (predominant in East Asia but also found in Europe, rabbits and guinea pigs). The new species T. africanum sp. nov. is proposed for the &quot,African&quot, race of T. benhamiae. The introduction to new geographic areas and host jump followed by extinction of one mating type gene have played important roles in the evolution of these pathogens. Due to considerable phenotypic similarity of many dermatophytes and phenomena such as incomplete lineage sorting or occasional hybridization and introgression, we demonstrate the need to follow polyphasic approach in species delimitation. Neutrally evolving and noncoding DNA regions showed significantly higher discriminatory power compared to conventional protein-coding loci. Diagnostic options for species identification in practice based on molecular markers, phenotype and MALDI-TOF spectra are presented.

If the agent’s problem is to choose the consumption levels of many goods with different degrees of substitutability, then she may create mental budgets for more substitutable products (e.g., entertainment). In some situations, it is optimal to specify budgets in terms of consumption quantities, but when most products have an abundance of substitutes, specifying budgets in terms of nominal spending tends to be optimal. If the goods are complements, in contrast, then the agent may—consistent with naive diversification—choose a fixed, unconsidered mix of products. And if the agent’s problem is to choose one of multiple products to fulfill a given consumption need (e.g., for gasoline or a bed), then it is often optimal for her to allocate a fixed sum for the need.",50201.0,"Kőszegi, B.:Matějka, Filip",Quarterly Journal of Economics,1,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fork Cleavage-Religation Cycle and Active Transcription Mediate Replication Restart after Fork Stalling at Co-transcriptional R-Loops,"Formation of co-transcriptional R-loops underlies replication fork stalling upon head-on transcription-replication encounters. Here, we demonstrate that RAD51-dependent replication fork reversal induced by R-loops is followed by the restart of semiconservative DNA replication mediated by RECQ1 and RECQ5 helicases, MUS81/EME1 endonuclease, RAD52 strand-annealing factor, the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)/XRCC4 complex, and the non-catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta, POLD3. RECQ5 disrupts RAD51 filaments assembled on stalled forks after RECQ1-mediated reverse branch migration, preventing a new round of fork reversal and facilitating fork cleavage by MUS81/EME1. MUS81-dependent DNA breaks accumulate in cells lacking RAD52 or LIG4 upon induction of R-loop formation, suggesting that RAD52 acts in concert with LIG4/XRCC4 to catalyze fork religation, thereby mediating replication restart. The resumption of DNA synthesis after R-loop-associated fork stalling also requires active transcription, the restoration of which depends on MUS81, RAD52, LIG4, and the transcription elongation factor ELL.

Emerging Subjectivity in Protest,"Subjectivity has been analyzed ever since an anthropology of resistance embarked on its turbulent voyage at the turn of the 1970s and 1980s. Sometimes more central, sometimes rendered secondary, the concept of subjectivity, embedded in various theoretical currents, has witnessed a fascinating boom of resistance studies in the 1980s, a breakdown after harsh critique in the 1990s, and a second breath of resuscitation, beginning lustily at the turn of the millennium, still breathing until today, and further conceptualized with new terms like urban protest, horizontal democracy, occupation, alter-globalization, anti-austerity mobilization, hacktivism, Arab spring or militant ethnography. The task of this chapter is to guide the reader through the flourishing field of anthropological studies, with regards to subjectivity in protest. The text is divided into three parts. The first, 'Disentangling the Field', provides an overview of key conceptualizations defining this current throughout its existence.

The effect of water on the validity of Lowenstein's rule,"The common understanding of zeolite acidity is based on Lowenstein&apos,s rule, which states that Al-O-Al aluminium pairs are forbidden in zeolites. This rule is generally accepted to be inviolate in zeolites. However, recent computational research using a 0 K DFT model has suggested that the rule is violated for the acid form of several zeolites under anhydrous conditions [Fletcher et al., Chem. Sci., 8, (2017), 7483]. The effect of water loading on the preferred aluminium distribution in zeolites, however, has so far not been taken into account. In this article, we show by way of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations that Lowenstein&apos,s rule is obeyed under high water solvation for acid chabazite (H-CHA) but disobeyed under anhydrous conditions. We find that varying the water loading in the pores leads to dramatic effects on the structure of the active sites and the dynamics of solvation. The solvation of BrOnsted protons in the surrounding water was found to be the energetic driving force for the preferred Lowenstein Al distribution and this driving force is absent in non-Lowenstein (Al-O(H)-Al) moieties. The preference for solvated protons further implies that the catalytically active species in zeolites is a protonated water cluster, rather than a framework BrOnsted site. Hence, an accurate treatment of the solvation conditions is crucial to capture the behaviour of zeolites and to properly connect simulations to experiments. This work should lead to a change in modelling paradigm for zeolites, from single molecules towards high solvation models where appropriate.",10403.0,"Heard, Christopher James:Grajciar, Lukáš:Nachtigall, Petr",Chemical Science,1,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
TUT-DIS3L2 is a mammalian surveillance pathway for aberrant structured non-coding RNAs,"Uridylation of various cellular RNA species at the 3' end has been generally linked to RNA degradation. In mammals, uridylated pre-let-7 miRNAs and mRNAs are targeted by the 3' to 5' exoribonuclease DIS3L2. Mutations in DIS3L2 have been associated with Perlman syndrome and with Wilms tumor susceptibility. Using in vivo cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) method, we discovered the DIS3L2-dependent cytoplasmic uridylome of human cells. We found a broad spectrum of uridylated RNAs including rRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, tRNAs, vault, 7SL, Y RNAs, mRNAs, lncRNAs, and transcripts from pseudogenes. The unifying features of most of these identified RNAs are aberrant processing and the presence of stable secondary structures. Most importantly, we demonstrate that uridylation mediates DIS3L2 degradation of short RNA polymerase II-derived RNAs.

Plasma membrane phospholipid signature recruits the plant exocyst complex via the EXO70A1 subunit,"Polarized exocytosis is essential for many vital processes in eukaryotic cells, where secretory vesicles are targeted to distinct plasma membrane domains characterized by their specific lipid-protein composition. Heterooctameric protein complex exocyst facilitates the vesicle tethering to a target membrane and is a principal cell polarity regulator in eukaryotes. The architecture and molecular details of plant exocyst and its membrane recruitment have remained elusive. Here, we show that the plant exocyst consists of two modules formed by SEC3-SEC5-SEC6-SEC8 and SEC10-SEC15-EXO70- EXO84 subunits, respectively, documenting the evolutionarily conserved architecture within eukaryotes. In contrast to yeast and mammals, the two modules are linked by a plant-specific SEC3- EXO70 interaction, and plant EXO70 functionally dominates over SEC3 in the exocyst recruitment to the plasma membrane. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we found that the C-terminal part of EXO70A1, the canonical EXO70 isoform in Arabidopsis, is critical for this process. In contrast to yeast and animal cells, the EXO70A1 interaction with the plasma membrane is mediated by multiple anionic phospholipids uniquely contributing to the plant plasma membrane identity. We identified several evolutionary conserved EXO70 lysine residues and experimentally proved their importance for the EXO70A1-phospholipid interactions. Collectively, our work has uncovered plant-specific features of the exocyst complex and emphasized the importance of the specific protein-lipid code for the recruitment of peripheral membrane proteins.",10601.0,"Synek, Lukáš:Pleskot, Roman:Sekereš, Juraj:Serrano, Natalia:Vukašinović, Nemanja:Ortmannová, Jitka:Klejchová, Martina:Pejchar, Přemysl:Batystová, Klára:Gutkowska, M.:Drdová, Edita:Marković, Vedrana:Pečenková, Tamara:Šantrůček, J.:Žárský, Viktor:Potocký, Martin",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Structure and genome ejection mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus phage P68,"Phages infecting Staphylococcus aureus can be used as therapeutics against antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. However, there is limited information about the mechanism of genome delivery of phages that infect Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we present the structures of native S. aureus phage P68, genome ejection intermediate, and empty particle. The P68 head contains 72 subunits of inner core protein, 15 of which bind to and alter the structure of adjacent major capsid proteins and thus specify attachment sites for head fibers. Unlike in the previously studied phages, the head fibers of P68 enable its virion to position itself at the cell surface for genome delivery. The unique interaction of one end of P68 DNA with one of the 12 portal protein subunits is disrupted before the genome ejection. The inner core proteins are released together with the DNA and enable the translocation of phage genome across the bacterial membrane into the cytoplasm.",10607.0,"Hrebík, Dominik:Štveráková, Dana:Škubník, Karel:Füzik, Tibor:Pantůček, Roman:Plevka, Pavel",Science advances,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and constraints on its couplings from a combined ATLAS and CMS analysis of the LHC pp collision data at √s = 7 and 8 TeV,"Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or a Z boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes H → ZZ, W W , γγ, ττ, bb, and μμ. All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb−1 at s√=7 TeV and 20 fb−1 at s√=8 TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers.

In this study, we explored the dynamics of free holes in methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr(3)) single crystals using the time-of-flight (ToF) current spectroscopy. By combining ToF spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulation, three energy states were detected in the bandgap of MAPbBr(3). In addition, we found the trapping and detrapping rates of free holes ranging from a few microseconds to hundreds of microseconds.

In particular, the existence of the σ-hole on halogen atoms has been demonstrated only indirectly through the determination of the crystal structures of organic molecules containing halogens or with theoretical calculations, consequently calling for its direct experimental visualization.

"Slipping Magnetic Reconnection, Chromospheric Evaporation, Implosion, and Precursors in the 2014 September 10 X1.6-Class Solar Flare","We investigate the occurrence of slipping magnetic reconnection, chromospheric evaporation, and coronal loop dynamics in the 2014 September 10 X-class flare. Slipping reconnection is found to be present throughout the flare from its early phase. Flare loops are seen to slip in opposite directions toward both ends of the ribbons. Velocities of 20-40 km s(-1) are found within time windows where the slipping is well resolved. The warm coronal loops exhibit expanding and contracting motions that are interpreted as displacements due to the growing flux rope that subsequently erupts. This flux rope existed and erupted before the onset of apparent coronal implosion. This indicates that the energy release proceeds by slipping reconnection and not via coronal implosion. The slipping reconnection leads to changes in the geometry of the observed structures at the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph slit position, from flare loop top to the footpoints in the ribbons. This results in variations of the observed velocities of chromospheric evaporation in the early flare phase. Finally, it is found that the precursor signatures, including localized EUV brightenings as well as nonthermal X-ray emission, are signatures of the flare itself, progressing from the early phase toward the impulsive phase, with the tether-cutting being provided by the slipping reconnection.

TIM-3 Dictates Functional Orientation of the Immune Infiltrate in Ovarian Cancer,"Purpose: In multiple oncological settings, expression of the coinhibitory ligand PD-L1 by malignant cells and tumor infiltration by immune cells expressing coinhibitory receptors such as PD-1, CTLA4, LAG-3, or TIM-3 conveys prognostic or predictive information. Conversely, the impact of these features of the tumor microenvironment on disease outcome among high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) patients remains controversial. Experimental Design: We harnessed a retrospective cohort of 80 chemotherapy-naive HGSC patients to investigate PD-L1 expression and tumor infiltration by CD8(+) T cells, CD20(+) B cells, DC-LAMP(+) dendritic cells as well as by PD-1(+), CTLA4(+), LAG-3(+), and TIM-3(+) cells in relation with prognosis and function orientation of the tumor microenvironment. IHC data were complemented with transcriptomic and functional studies on a second prospective cohort of freshly resected HGSC samples. In silico analysis of publicly available RNA expression data from 308 HGSC samples was used as a confirmatory approach. Results: High levels of PD-L1 and high densities of PD-1(+) cells in the microenvironment of HGSCs were strongly associated with an immune contexture characterized by a robust TH1 polarization and cytotoxic orientation that enabled superior clinical benefits. Moreover, PD-1(+) TIM-3(+) CD8(+) T cells presented all features of functional exhaustion and correlated with poor disease outcome. However, although PD-L1 levels and tumor infiltration by TIM-3(+) cells improved patient stratification based on the intratumoral abundance of CD8(+) T cells, the amount of PD-1(+) cells failed to do so.

Benchmark campaign and case study episode in central Europe for development and assessment of advanced GNSS tropospheric models and products,"Initial objectives and design of the Benchmark campaign organized within the European COST Action ES1206 (2013-2017) are described in the paper. This campaign has aimed to support the development and validation of advanced Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) tropospheric products, in particular high-resolution and ultrafast zenith total delays (ZTDs) and tropospheric gradients derived from a dense permanent network. A complex data set was collected for the 8-week period when several extreme heavy precipitation episodes occurred in central Europe which caused severe river floods in this area. An initial processing of data sets from GNSS products and numerical weather models (NWMs) provided independently estimated reference parameters - zenith tropospheric delays and tropospheric horizontal gradients. Their provision gave an overview about the product similarities and complementarities, and thus a potential for improvements of a synergy in their optimal exploitations in future. Reference GNSS and NWM results were intercompared and visually analysed using animated maps. ZTDs from two reference GNSS solutions compared to global ERA-Interim reanalysis resulted in accuracy at the 10 mm level in terms of the root mean square (rms) with a negligible overall bias, comparisons to Global Forecast System (GFS) forecasts showed accuracy at the 12 mm level with the overall bias of -5 mm and, finally, comparisons to mesoscale ALADIN-CZ forecast resulted in accuracy at the 8 mm level with a negligible total bias. The comparison of horizontal tropospheric gradients from GNSS and NWM data demonstrated a very good agreement among independent solutions with negligible biases and an accuracy of about 0.5 mm.

"Comparative ""Omics"" of the Fusarium fujikuroi Species Complex Highlights Differences in Genetic Potential and Metabolite Synthesis","Species of the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (FFC) cause a wide spectrum of often devastating diseases on diverse agricultural crops, including coffee, fig, mango, maize, rice, and sugarcane. Although species within the FFC are difficult to distinguish by morphology, and their genes often share 90% sequence similarity, they can differ in host plant specificity and life style. FFC species can also produce structurally diverse secondary metabolites (SMs), including the mycotoxins fumonisins, fusarins, fusaric acid, and beauvericin, and the phytohormones gibberellins, auxins, and cytokinins. The spectrum of SMs produced can differ among closely related species, suggesting that SMs might be determinants of host specificity. To date, genomes of only a limited number of FFC species have been sequenced. Here, we provide draft genome sequences of three more members of the FFC: a single isolate of F. mangiferae, the cause of mango malformation, and two isolates of F. proliferatum, one a pathogen of maize and the other an orchid endophyte. We compared these genomes to publicly available genome sequences of three other FFC species. The comparisons revealed species-specific and isolate-specific differences in the composition and expression (in vitro and in planta) of genes involved in SM production including those for phytohormome biosynthesis.

To elucidate this multifaceted role of cytokinin in leaf development, we have employed a system of temporal controls over the cytokinin pool and investigated the consequences of modulated cytokinin levels in the third leaf of Arabidopsis. We show that, at the cell proliferation phase, cytokinin is needed to maintain cell proliferation by blocking the transition to cell expansion and the onset of photosynthesis. Transcriptome profiling revealed regulation by cytokinin of a gene suite previously shown to affect cell proliferation and expansion and thereby a molecular mechanism by which cytokinin modulates a molecular network underlying the cellular responses. During the cell expansion phase, cytokinin stimulates cell expansion and differentiation. Consequently, a cytokinin excess at the cell expansion phase results in an increased leaf and rosette size fueled by higher cell expansion rate, yielding higher shoot biomass. Proteome profiling revealed the stimulation of primary metabolism by cytokinin, in line with an increased sugar content that is expected to increase turgor pressure, representing the driving force of cell expansion. Therefore, the developmental timing of cytokinin content fluctuations, together with a tight control of primary metabolism, is a key factor mediating transitions from cell proliferation to cell expansion in leaves.",10611.0,"Skalák, Jan:Vercruyssen, Liesbeth:Claeys, Hannes:Hradilová, Jana:Černý, Martin:Novák, Ondřej:Plačková, Lenka:Saiz Fernandez, Inigo:Skaláková, Patricie:Coppens, Frederik:Dhondt, Stijn:Koukalová, Šárka:Zouhar, Jan:Inzé, Dirk:Brzobohatý, Břetislav",Plant Journal,1,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tempering Rayleigh's curse with PSF shaping,"It has been argued that, for a spatially invariant imaging system, the information one can gain about the separation of two incoherent point sources decays quadratically to zero with decreasing separation. The effect is termed Rayleigh&apos,s curse. Contrary to this belief, we identify a class of point-spread functions (PSFs) with a linear information decrease. Moreover, we show that any well-behaved symmetric PSF can be converted into such a form with a simple nonabsorbing signum filter.

Let the Punishment Fit the Criminal: An Experimental Study,"We use a laboratory experiment to study the extent to which people tailor levels of punishment to the subjective experience of the person to receive that punishment, for both monetary and non-monetary sanctions. We find that subjects tend to apply higher fines to wealthier individuals. Additionally, subjects assign more repetitions of a tedious task to those with a lower willingness to pay to avoid it. We find no evidence that the distributions of monetary and non-monetary punishments are different when considered as proportions of the maximum possible punishment, but that this does not hold when non-monetary punishments are converted into monetary equivalents. This suggests that subjects do not have in mind a particular level of disutility from the punishment, but rather are guided by the sentencing possibilities.",50501.0,"Montag, Josef:Tremewan, James",Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization,1,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nrf2-Mediated Antioxidant Defense and Peroxiredoxin 6 Are Linked to Biosynthesis of Palmitic Acid Ester of 9-Hydroxystearic Acid,"Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are lipid mediators with promising antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties that are formed in white adipose tissue (WAT) via de novo lipogenesis, but their biosynthetic enzymes are unknown. Using a combination of lipidomics in WAT, quantitative trait locus mapping, and correlation analyses in rat BXH/HXB recombinant inbred strains, as well as response to oxidative stress in murine models, we elucidated the potential pathway of biosynthesis of several FAHFAs. Comprehensive analysis of WAT samples identified ∼160 regioisomers, documenting the complexity of this lipid class. The linkage analysis highlighted several members of the nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant defense system (Prdx6, Mgst1, Mgst3), lipid-handling proteins (Cd36, Scd6, Acnat1, Acnat2, Baat), and the family of flavin containing monooxygenases (Fmo) as the positional candidate genes. Transgenic expression of Nrf2 and deletion of Prdx6 genes resulted in reduction of palmitic acid ester of 9-hydroxystearic acid (9-PAHSA) and 11-PAHSA levels, while oxidative stress induced by an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis increased PAHSA levels nonspecifically. Our results indicate that the synthesis of FAHFAs via carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein–driven de novo lipogenesis depends on the adaptive antioxidant system and suggest that FAHFAs may link activity of this system with insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.",30202.0,"Kuda, Ondřej:Březinová, Marie:Šilhavý, Jan:Landa, Vladimír:Zídek, Václav:Dodia, Ch.:Kreuchwig, F.:Vrbacký, Marek:Balas, L.:Durand, T.:Hübner, N.:Fisher, A.

Here we present a robust protocol for the full-length profiling of human and mouse IG repertoires. This protocol uses unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) introduced in the course of cDNA synthesis to control bottlenecks and to eliminate PCR and sequencing errors. Using asymmetric 400+100-nt paired-end Illumina sequencing and UMI-based assembly with the new version of the MIGEC software, the protocol allows up to 750-nt lengths to be sequenced in an almost error-free manner. This sequencing approach should also be applicable to various tasks beyond immune repertoire studies. In IG profiling, the achieved length of high-quality sequence covers the variable region of even the longest chains, along with the fragment of a constant region carrying information on the antibody isotype.

Smarcal1-Mediated Fork Reversal Triggers Mre11-Dependent Degradation of Nascent DNA in the Absence of Brca2 and Stable Rad51 Nucleofilaments,"Brca2 deficiency causes Mre11-dependent degradation of nascent DNA at stalled forks, leading to cell lethality. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, we isolated Xenopus laevis Brca2. We demonstrated that Brca2 protein prevents single-stranded DNA gap accumulation at replication fork junctions and behind them by promoting Rad51 binding to replicating DNA. Without Brca2, forks with persistent gaps are converted by Smarcal1 into reversed forks, triggering extensive Mre11-dependent nascent DNA degradation. Stable Rad51 nucleofilaments, but not RPA or Rad51T131P mutant proteins, directly prevent Mre11-dependent DNA degradation. Mre11 inhibition instead promotes reversed fork accumulation in the absence of Brca2. Rad51 directly interacts with the Pol α N-terminal domain, promoting Pol α and δ binding to stalled replication forks. This interaction likely promotes replication fork restart and gap avoidance. These results indicate that Brca2 and Rad51 prevent formation of abnormal DNA replication intermediates, whose processing by Smarcal1 and Mre11 predisposes to genome instability.",10608.0,"Kolinjivadi, Am:Sannino, V.:De Antoni, A.:Zadorozhny, K.:Kilkenny, M.:Técher, H.:Baldi, G.:Shen, R.:Ciccia, A.:Pellegrini, L.:Krejčí, Lumír:Costanzo, V.",Molecular Cell,1,high,high,0,0,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Frequency modulation reveals the phasing of orbital eccentricity during Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event II and the Eocene hyperthermals,"Major advances in our understanding of paleoclimate change derive from a precise reconstruction of the periods, amplitudes and phases of the Milankovitch cycles’ of precession, obliquity and eccentricity. While numerous quantitativeapproaches exist for the identification of these astronomical cycles in stratigraphic data, limitations in radioisotopic dating, and instability of the theoretical astronomical solutions beyond ∼50 Myr ago, can challenge identification of the phase relationships needed to constrain climate response and anchor floating astrochronologies. Here we demonstrate that interference patterns accompanying frequency modulation (FM) of short eccentricity provide a robust basis for identifying the phase of long eccentricity forcing in stratigraphic data. One-and two-dimensional models of sedimentary distortion of the astronomical signal are used to evaluate the veracity of the FM method, and indicate that pristine eccentricity FM can be readily distinguishedin paleo-records.

Progress in waste utilization via thermal plasma,"As the world races toward its urban future, the quantity of wastes, one of the vital by-products of an enhancement in the standards of living, is exponentially rising. The treatment of wastes employing plasma is an upcoming area of research and is globally used for the simultaneous processing of diverse wastes coupled with the recovery of energy and materials. Ground-breaking and cost-effective thermal plasma technologies with high efficiencies are a prerequisite for the growth of this technology. This paper delivers an evaluation of the fundamentals such as the generation and characteristics of the thermal plasma along with the various types of wastes treatable by thermal plasma and the related issues. Furthermore, the authors discuss different types of advanced technologies as well as the material and energy recovery techniques and their present status worldwide, at lab-scale and industrial scale. The application of different thermal plasma technologies is discussed as a means to promote this technology into alternative applications, which require higher flexibility and greater efficiency. Mathematical modeling studies are also assessed with an objective to derive ideal conditions and permissible limits for the reactors and to test a variety of waste materials.

"The Story of the Prophet Muḥammad's encounter with a Samaritan, a Jew, and a Christian: the version from Abū l-Fatḥ's Kitāb al-Tārīkh and Its Context","In the year 756/1355 Abū l-Fatḥ ibn Abī l-Ḥasan al-Sāmirī al-Danafī wrote the Samaritan chronicle Kitāb al-Tārīkh, which concludes with a cycle of legends narrating the rise of Islam. Their narrative focuses on the story of the prophet Muḥammad&apos,s encounter with three astrologers, representatives of three Abrahamic religions: a Samaritan, a Jew, and a Christian. They saw in the stars the end of the rule of Byzantium and the rise of the rule of Ishmael, i.e., Islam, and therefore came to Muḥammad in Medina to find out whether he was the man from the stock of Ishmael with whom the rule of Islam in the world had begun. When assured that Muḥammad was the king promised in the Scriptures, so the story goes, the Jew and the Christian converted to Islam, whilst the Samaritan stayed steadfast in his religion and negotiated with Muḥammad full protection for the Samaritans under Islam. Abū l-Fatḥ&apos,s narrative presents a unique Samaritan version of a polemical story that was widespread among the Christians and Jews in the Middle Ages. The paper compares the Samaritan version of the story with the Christian and Jewish ones, and sets the story of Muḥammad&apos,s pact with the Samaritans into the context of the mid-14th century Mamlūk society and the Samaritans&apos, position in it. The thesis of the paper is that the Samaritan version responds to the increasing social and religious pressure of Islamic society directed towards the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam and the expropriation of their houses of worship.",60101.0,"Boušek, Daniel","The Samaritans in Historical, Cultural and Linguistic Perspectives",1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition),"In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide.

DNA Damage Changes Distribution Pattern and Levels of HP1 Protein Isoforms in the Nucleolus and Increases Phosphorylation of HP1 beta-Ser88,"The family of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) isoforms is essential for chromatin packaging, regulation of gene expression, and repair of damaged DNA. Here we document that gamma-radiation reduced the number of HP1 alpha-positive foci, but not HP1 beta and HP1 gamma foci, located in the vicinity of the fibrillarin-positive region of the nucleolus. The additional analysis confirmed that gamma-radiation has the ability to significantly decrease the level of HP1 alpha in rDNA promoter and rDNA encoding 28S rRNA. By mass spectrometry, we showed that treatment by gamma-rays enhanced the HP1 beta serine 88 phosphorylation (S88ph), but other analyzed modifications of HP1 beta, including S161ph/Y163ph, S171ph, and S174ph, were not changed in cells exposed to gamma-rays or treated by the HDAC inhibitor (HDACi). Interestingly, a combination of HDACi and gamma-radiation increased the level of HP1 alpha and HP1 gamma. The level of HP1 beta remained identical before and after the HDACi/gamma-rays treatment, but HDACi strengthened HP1 beta interaction with the KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) protein. Conversely, HP1 gamma did not interact with KAP1, although approximately 40% of HP1 gamma foci co-localized with accumulated KAP1. Especially HP1 gamma foci at the periphery of nucleoli were mostly absent of KAP1. Together, DNA damage changed the morphology, levels, and interaction properties of HP1 isoforms. Also, gamma-irradiation-induced hyperphosphorylation of the HP1 beta protein, thus, HP1 beta-S88ph could be considered as an important marker of DNA damage.",10601.0,"Legartová, Soňa:Lochmanová, G.:Zdráhal, Z.:Kozubek, Stanislav:Šponer, Jiří:Krepl, Miroslav:Pokorná, Pavlína:Bártová, Eva",Cells,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

"Citizen, consumer, citimer: The interplay of market and political identities within contemporary football fan cultures","This article examines how football, sport and other cultural fields are characterized by complex interrelations between citizen&apos, and consumer&apos, identities. Our analysis centres specifically on critically examining and developing the concept of citimer&apos, (citizen-consumer) with respect to activist supporter groups within European professional men&apos,s football. First, to establish the structural and cultural context for our analysis, we argue that the emergence of citizen-consumer identities in football has been driven by five underlying processes: globalization, commodification, securitization, mediatization and postmodernization. Critical football fan movements have responded to these changes through greater reflexivization and politicization. Second, drawing on the broad academic literature, we develop the concept of the citizen-consumer (or citimer&apos,) and introduce its relevance to football. Third, to provide a more nuanced understanding of the citizen-consumer, we explore how this citimer&apos, identity is constructed in two ways: from below&apos, (by fan groups themselves at everyday level) and from above&apos, (by clubs, governing bodies, media and other powerful forces within the football system). In both instances, we find that the citizen and consumer aspects of the citimer identity are interrelated in complex ways. Fourth, we conclude by highlighting the political reflexivity of citimers and areas for future research. Our analysis draws on extensive data collection: with football supporters and officials in the Czech Republic, England and Italy and at the wider European level, and through access to diverse primary and secondary documents (e.g. policy papers, fanzines and online forums).

History as the Progress in the (Un)Consciousness of Freedom?,"The article deals with the Enlightenment conception of freedom as propounded by Kant and as re-interpreted by Hegel. Although for Kant, the source of normativity is practical reason as embodied in the categorical imperative and good will, Hegel contends that this criterion removes the essence of action from the world into a subjective intention. Against Kant, Hegel emphasizes that in focusing on the subjective side of action, we fail to understand that freedom is always realized in concert with others. In this sense, he emphasizes that there are social conditions that enable or disable free acting, and above all, one&apos,s freedom depends on the quantity of the freedom of others: The more there are free people, the more evolved the freedom is. As essennially plural, freedom is conditioned by an institutional framework, the &quot,syntax of objective thought.&quot, The author argues that due to this institutional dimension of freedom, the outcome of Hegel&apos,s philosophy is paradoxical. It is only as long as man is not free that he needs an explicit consciousness of freedom, once he or she finds himself or herself in a free society, i.e., in a society with institutionally secured basic freedoms, he need not maintain a vigilant sense of freedom.",60301.0,"Matějčková, Tereza",Concepts of Normativity: Kant or Hegel?,1,medium,high,0,0,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
An RNA aptamer restores defective bone growth in FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia in mice,"Achondroplasia is the most prevalent genetic form of dwarfism in humans and is caused by activating mutations in FGFR3 tyrosine kinase. The clinical need for a safe and effective inhibitor of FGFR3 is unmet, leaving achondroplasia currently incurable. Here, we evaluated RBM-007, an RNA aptamer previously developed to neutralize the FGFR3 ligand FGF2, for its activity against FGFR3. In cultured rat chondrocytes or mouse embryonal tibia organ culture, RBM-007 rescued the proliferation arrest, degradation of cartilaginous extracellular matrix, premature senescence, and impaired hypertrophic differentiation induced by FGFR3 signaling. In cartilage xenografts derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with achondroplasia, RBM-007 rescued impaired chondrocyte differentiation and maturation. When delivered by subcutaneous injection, RBM-007 restored defective skeletal growth in a mouse model of achondroplasia.

Gut Microbiome of Coexisting BaAka Pygmies and Bantu Reflects Gradients of Traditional Subsistence Patterns,"To understand how the gut microbiome is impacted by human adaptation to varying environments, we explored gut bacterial communities in the BaAka rainforest hunter-gatherers and their agriculturalist Bantu neighbors in the Central African Republic. Although the microbiome of both groups is compositionally similar, hunter-gatherers harbor increased abundance of Prevotellaceae, Treponema, and Clostridiaceae, while the Bantu gut microbiome is dominated by Firmicutes. Comparisons with US Americans reveal microbiome differences between Africans and westerners but show western-like features in the Bantu, including an increased abundance of predictive carbohydrate and xenobiotic metabolic pathways. In contrast, the hunter-gatherer gut shows increased abundance of predicted virulence, amino acid, and vitamin metabolism functions, as well as dominance of lipid and amino-acid-derived metabolites, as determined through metabolomics. Our results demonstrate gradients of traditional subsistence patterns in two neighboring African groups and highlight the adaptability of the microbiome in response to host ecology.",0.0,"Gomez, Andres:Petrzelkova, Klara J.:Burns, Michael B.:Yeoman, Carl J.:Amato, Katherine R.:Vlčková, Klára:Modrý, David:Todd, Angelique:Robinson, Carolyn A.

Occurrence of microplastics in raw and treated drinking water,"The study investigates the content of microplastic particles in freshwater and drinking water. Specifically, three water treatment plants (WTPs) supplied by different kinds of water bodies were selected and their raw and treated water was analysed for microplastics (MPs). Microplastics were found in all water samples and their average abundance ranged from 1473 +/- 34 to 3605 +/- 497 particles L-1 in raw water and from 338 +/- 76 to 628 +/- 28 particles L-1 in treated water, depending on the WTP. This study is one of very few that determine microplastics down to the size of 1 mu m, while MPs smaller than 10 mu m were the most plentiful in both raw and treated water samples, accounting for up to 95%. Further, MPs were divided into three categories according to their shape. Fragments clearly prevailed at two of the WTPs and fibres together with fragments predominated at one case. Despite 12 different materials forming the microplastics being identified, the majority of the MPs (>70%) comprised of PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PP (polypropylene) and PE (polyethylene). This study contributes to fill the knowledge gap in the field of emerging microplastic pollution of drinking water and water sources, which is of concern due to the potential exposure of microplastics to humans.",10511.0,"Pivokonský, Martin:Čermáková, Lenka:Novotná, Kateřina:Peer, Petra:Cajthaml, T.:Janda, V.",Science of the Total Environment,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Assessment of the influence of adaptive E-learning on learning effectiveness of primary school pupils,"The paper deals with assessment of the influence of adaptive e-learning as a part of learning analytics on learning effectiveness of primary school pupils. E-learning exercises containing implemented adaptive elements were created in accordance with the Bloom&apos,s Taxonomy. Within the pilot study the authors detected high percentage success rate during e-learning exercise completion. This leads to formulation of the question „Can any e-learning exercise of lower cognitive levels of Bloom&apos,s taxonomy be skipped without affecting the cognitive thinking for solution of the e-learning exercises on upper cognitive levels of Bloom&apos,s taxonomy?” To answer the question, the algorithm of adaptive e-learning was defined and hypotheses were established. The research was carried out as pedagogical experiment comparing the results of both experimental and control groups of pupils. The research hypotheses were confirmed by statistical analysis of the research data. The results confirm that adaptive features of e-learning can be implemented in the primary education. The research results confirm the fact that educational objectives can be achieved with some pupils more effectively. Consequently, the implementation of adaptive elements into e-learning at the primary school supports an individual approach when completing e-learning exercises according to the principle of cognitive computing.",50301.0,"Hubálovský, Štěpán:Hubálovská, Marie:Musílek, Michal",Computers in human behavior,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

RanGTP and importin beta regulate meiosis I spindle assembly and function in mouse oocytes,"Homologous chromosome segregation during meiosis I (MI) in mammalian oocytes is carried out by the acentrosomal MI spindles. Whereas studies in human oocytes identified Ran GTPase as a crucial regulator of the MI spindle function, experiments in mouse oocytes questioned the generality of this notion. Here, we use live-cell imaging with fluorescent probes and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors to monitor the changes in Ran and importin beta signaling induced by perturbations of Ran in mouse oocytes while examining the MI spindle dynamics. We show that unlike RanT24N employed in previous studies, a RanT24N, T42A double mutant inhibits RanGEF without perturbing cargo binding to importin beta and disrupts MI spindle function in chromosome segregation. Roles of Ran and importin beta in the coalescence of microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) and MI spindle assembly are further supported by the use of the chemical inhibitor importazole, whose effects are partially rescued by the GTP hydrolysis-resistant RanQ69L mutant.

Obesity as a Risk Factor for Accelerated Brain Ageing in First-Episode Psychosis: A Longitudinal Study,"Obesity is highly prevalent in schizophrenia, with implications for psychiatric prognosis, possibly through links between obesity and brain structure. In this longitudinal study in first episode of psychosis (FEP), we used machine learning and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the impact of psychotic illness and obesity on brain ageing/neuroprogression shortly after illness onset. Methods: We acquired 2 prospective MRI scans on average 1.61 years apart in 183 FEP and 155 control individuals. We used a machine learning model trained on an independent sample of 504 controls to estimate the individual brain ages of study participants and calculated BrainAGE by subtracting chronological from the estimated brain age. Results: Individuals with FEP had a higher initial BrainAGE than controls (3.39 ± 6.36 vs 1.72 ± 5.56 years, β = 1.68, t(336) = 2.59, P = .01), but similar annual rates of brain ageing over time (1.28 ± 2.40 vs 1.07±1.74 estimated years/actual year, t(333) = 0.93, P = .18). Across both cohorts, greater baseline body mass index (BMI) predicted faster brain ageing (β = 0.08, t(333) = 2.59, P = .01). For each additional BMI point, the brain aged by an additional month per year. Worsening of functioning over time (Global Assessment of Functioning, β = −0.04, t(164) = −2.48, P = .01) and increases especially in negative symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (β = 0.11, t(175) = 3.11, P = .002) were associated with faster brain ageing in FEP. Conclusions: Brain alterations in psychosis are manifest already during the first episode and over time get worse in those with worsening clinical outcomes or higher baseline BMI. As baseline BMI predicted faster brain ageing, obesity may represent a modifiable risk factor in FEP that is linked with psychiatric outcomes via effects on brain structure.",30215.0,"McWhinney, Sean:Kolenič, Marián:Franke, Katja:Mertlová, Markéta:Knytl, Pavel:Matějka, Martin:Španiel, Filip:Hájek, Tomáš",Schizophrenia Bulletin,1,low,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

In this context, we present a cross-linguistic study of multimodal event construals in Czech and English spontaneous conversations, based on multimodal corpora. We follow Croft&apos,s (2012) cognitive model of aspectual types, in order to take into account multiple parameters (out of which the features of (un)boundedness and directedness are the most prominent) determining a particular aspectual contour of a verb in a given context. We investigate which feature combinations are associated with (un)boundedness of corresponding co-speech gestures.

Mycobacterial HelD is a nucleic acids-clearing factor for RNA polymerase,"RNA synthesis is central to life, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) depends on accessory factors for recovery from stalled states and adaptation to environmental changes. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which a helicase-like factor HelD recycles RNAP. We report a cryo-EM structure of a complex between the Mycobacterium smegmatis RNAP and HelD. The crescent-shaped HelD simultaneously penetrates deep into two RNAP channels that are responsible for nucleic acids binding and substrate delivery to the active site, thereby locking RNAP in an inactive state. We show that HelD prevents non-specific interactions between RNAP and DNA and dissociates stalled transcription elongation complexes. The liberated RNAP can either stay dormant, sequestered by HelD, or upon HelD release, restart transcription. Our results provide insights into the architecture and regulation of the highly medically-relevant mycobacterial transcription machinery and define HelD as a clearing factor that releases RNAP from nonfunctional complexes with nucleic acids.",10606.0,"Kouba, T.:Koval, Tomáš:Sudzinová, Petra:Pospíšil, Jiří:Brezovská, Barbora:Hnilicová, Jarmila:Šanderová, Hana:Janoušková, Martina:Šiková, Michaela:Halada, Petr:Sýkora, Michal:Barvík, I.:Nováček, J.:Trundová, Mária:Dušková, Jarmila:Skálová, Tereza:Chon, U.

Carbonate-sensitive phytotransferrin controls high-affinity iron uptake in diatoms,"In vast areas of the ocean, the scarcity of iron controls the growth and productivity of phytoplankton. Although most dissolved iron in the marine environment is complexed with organic molecules, picomolar amounts of labile inorganic iron species (labile iron) are maintained within the euphotic zone and serve as an important source of iron for eukaryotic phytoplankton and particularly for diatoms. Genome-enabled studies of labile iron utilization by diatoms have previously revealed novel iron-responsive transcripts, including the ferric iron-concentrating protein ISIP2A, but the mechanism behind the acquisition of picomolar labile iron remains unknown. Here we show that ISIP2A is a phytotransferrin that independently and convergently evolved carbonate ion-coordinated ferric iron binding. Deletion of ISIP2A disrupts high-affinity iron uptake in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and uptake is restored by complementation with human transferrin. ISIP2A is internalized by endocytosis, and manipulation of the seawater carbonic acid system reveals a second-order dependence on the concentrations of labile iron and carbonate ions. In P. tricornutum, the synergistic interaction of labile iron and carbonate ions occurs at environmentally relevant concentrations, revealing that carbonate availability co-limits iron uptake. Phytotransferrin sequences have a broad taxonomic distribution and are abundant in marine environmental genomic datasets, suggesting that acidification-driven declines in the concentration of seawater carbonate ions will have a negative effect on this globally important eukaryotic iron acquisition mechanism.",10611.0,"McQuaid, J.

Light-induced modulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity: possibilities and limitations,"Biological effects of high fluence low-power (HFLP) lasers have been reported for some time, yet the molecular mechanisms procuring cellular responses remain obscure. A better understanding of the effects of HFLP lasers on living cells will be instrumental for the development of new experimental and therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we investigated sub-cellular mechanisms involved in the laser interaction with human hepatic cell lines. We show that mitochondria serve as sub-cellular “sensor” and “effector” of laser light non-specific interactions with cells. We demonstrated that despite blue and red laser irradiation results in similar apoptotic death, cellular signaling and kinetic of biochemical responses are distinct.

However, the structure of the TBEV virion and its interactions with antibodies are unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the native TBEV virion and its complex with Fab fragments of neutralizing antibody 19/1786. Flavivirus genome delivery depends on membrane fusion that is triggered at low pH. The virion structure indicates that the repulsive interactions of histidine side chains, which become protonated at low pH, may contribute to the disruption of heterotetramers of the TBEV envelope and membrane proteins and induce detachment of the envelope protein ectodomains from the virus membrane. The Fab fragments bind to 120 out of the 180 envelope glycoproteins of the TBEV virion. Unlike most of the previously studied flavivirus-neutralizing antibodies, the Fab fragments do not lock the E-proteins in the native-like arrangement, but interfere with the process of virus-induced membrane fusion.",10607.0,"Füzik, Tibor:Formanova, P.:Ruzek, D.:Yoshii, K.:Niedrig, M.:Plevka, Pavel",Nature Communications,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
TSSC4 is a component of U5 snRNP that promotes tri-snRNP formation,"U5 snRNP is a complex particle essential for RNA splicing. U5 snRNPs undergo intricate biogenesis that ensures that only a fully mature particle assembles into a splicing competent U4/U6 center dot U5 tri-snRNP and enters the splicing reaction. During splicing, U5 snRNP is substantially rearranged and leaves as a U5/PRPF19 post-splicing particle, which requires re-generation before the next round of splicing. Here, we show that a previously uncharacterized protein TSSC4 is a component of U5 snRNP that promotes tri-snRNP formation. We provide evidence that TSSC4 associates with U5 snRNP chaperones, U5 snRNP and the U5/PRPF19 particle. Specifically, TSSC4 interacts with U5-specific proteins PRPF8, EFTUD2 and SNRNP200. We also identified TSSC4 domains critical for the interaction with U5 snRNP and the PRPF19 complex, as well as for TSSC4 function in tri-snRNP assembly. TSSC4 emerges as a specific chaperone that acts in U5 snRNP de novo biogenesis as well as post-splicing recycling. The correct assembly and recycling of the multicomponent spliceosome remains largely elusive. Here, the authors show that a previously uncharacterized protein TSSC4 associates with de novo formed spliceosomal U5 snRNP as well as with a post-splicing U5-PRPF19 particle, and that TSSC4 is important for assembly of the splicing competent tri-snRNP.",10608.0,"Klimešová, Klára:Vojáčková, Jitka:Radivojevic, Nenad:Vandermoere, F.:Bertrand, E.:Verheggen, C.:Staněk, David",Nature Communications,1,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nanoscale Dynamic Readout of a Chemical Redox Process Using Radicals Coupled with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Nanodiamonds,"Biocompatible nanoscale probes for sensitive detection of paramagnetic species and molecules associated with their (bio)chemical transformations would provide a desirable tool for a better understanding of cellular redox processes. Here, we describe an analytical tool based on quantum sensing techniques. We magnetically coupled negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) with nitroxide radicals present in a bioinert polymer coating of the NDs. We demonstrated that the T1 spin relaxation time of the NV centers is very sensitive to the number of nitroxide radicals, with a resolution down to ∼10 spins per ND (detection of approximately 10–23 mol in a localized volume).

Variability in the Clearance of Lead Oxide Nanoparticles Is Associated with Alteration of Specific Membrane Transporters,"Lead oxide nanoparticles (PbONPs), upon their entry into the lungs via inhalation, induce structural changes in primary and secondary target organs. The fate and ultrastructural localization of PbONPs in organs is known to be dependent on the specific organ. Here, we focused on the differences in the ability to clear the inhaled PbONPs from secondary target organs and on molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to nanoparticle removal. Mice were exposed to PbONPs in whole-body inhalation chambers. Clearance of ionic lead and PbONPs (Pb/PbONPs) from the lungs and liver was very effective, with the lead being almost completely eliminated from the lungs and the physiological state of the lung tissue conspicuously restored. Kidneys exposed to nanoparticles did not exhibit serious signs of damage, however, LA-ICP-MS uncovered a certain amount of lead located preferentially in the kidney cortex even after a clearance period. The concentration of lead in femurs, as representatives of the axial skeleton, was the highest among studied organs at all designated time points after PbONP exposure, and the clearance ability of lead from the femurs was very low in contrast to other organs. The organ-specific increase of ABC transporters expression (ABCG2 in lungs and ABCC3 in the liver) was observed in exposed animals, suggesting their involvement in removing Pb/PbONPs from tissues. Moreover, the expression of caveolins and clathrin displayed a tissue-specific response to lead exposure. Our results uncovered high variability among the organs in their ability to clear Pb/PbONPs and in the transporters involved in this process.",30108.0,"Dumková, Jana:Smutná, Tereza:Vrlíková, Lucie:Kotasová, Hana:Dočekal, Bohumil:Čapka, Lukáš:Kuchynka, Michaela:Jakešová, Veronika:Pelková, Vendula:Křůmal, Kamil:Coufalík, Pavel:Mikuška, Pavel:Večeřa, Zbyněk:Vaculovič, Tomáš:Husáková, Zuzana:Kanický, Viktor:Hampl, Aleš:Buchtová, marcela",ACS Nano,1,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Multimerization rules for G-quadruplexes,"G-quadruplexes can multimerize under certain conditions, but the sequence requirements of such structures are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the ability of all possible variants of the central tetrad in a monomeric, parallel-strand G-quadruplex to form higher-order structures. Although most of these 256 variants existed primarily as monomers under the conditions of our screen, similar to 10% formed dimers or tetramers. These structures could form in a wide range of monovalent and divalent metal ions, and folding was highly cooperative in both KCl and MgCl2. As was previously shown for G-quadruplexes that bind GTP and promote peroxidase reactions, G-quadruplexes that form dimers and tetramers have distinct sequence requirements. Some mutants could also form heteromultimers, and a second screen was performed to characterize the sequence requirements of these structures. Taken together, these experiments provide new insights into the sequence requirements and structures of both homomultimeric and heteromultimeric G-quadruplexes.",10608.0,"Kolesnikova, Sofia:Hubálek, Martin:Bednárová, Lucie:Cvačka, Josef:Curtis, Edward A.",Nucleic Acids Research,1,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Gaussian Boson Sampling,"Boson sampling has emerged as a tool to explore the advantages of quantum over classical computers as it does not require universal control over the quantum system, which favors current photonic experimental platforms. Here, we introduce Gaussian Boson sampling, a classically hard-to-solve problem that uses squeezed states as a nonclassical resource. We relate the probability to measure specific photon patterns from a general Gaussian state in the Fock basis to a matrix function called the Hafnian, which answers the last remaining question of sampling from Gaussian states. Based on this result, we design Gaussian Boson sampling, a #P hard problem, using squeezed states. This demonstrates that Boson sampling from Gaussian states is possible, with significant advantages in the photon generation probability, compared to existing protocols.",10306.0,"Hamilton, Craig:Kruse, R.:Sansoni, L.:Barkhofen, S.:Silberhorn, C.:Jex, Igor",Physical Review Letters,1,medium,high,1,0,medium,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Niche-directed evolution modulates genome architecture in freshwater Planctomycetes,"Freshwater environments teem with microbes that do not have counterparts in culture collections or genetic data available in genomic repositories. Currently, our apprehension of evolutionary ecology of freshwater bacteria is hampered by the difficulty to establish organism models for the most representative clades. To circumvent the bottlenecks inherent to the cultivation-based techniques, we applied ecogenomics approaches in order to unravel the evolutionary history and the processes that drive genome architecture in hallmark freshwater lineages from the phylum Planctomycetes. The evolutionary history inferences showed that sediment/soil Planctomycetes transitioned to aquatic environments, where they gave rise to new freshwater-specific clades. The most abundant lineage was found to have the most specialised lifestyle (increased regulatory genetic circuits, metabolism tuned for mineralization of proteinaceous sinking aggregates, psychrotrophic behaviour) within the analysed clades and to harbour the smallest freshwater Planctomycetes genomes, highlighting a genomic architecture shaped by niche-directed evolution (through loss of functions and pathways not needed in the newly acquired freshwater niche).",10606.0,"Andrei, Adrian-Stefan:Salcher, Michaela M.:Mehrshad, Maliheh:Rychtecký, Pavel:Znachor, Petr:Ghai, Rohit",The ISME Journal,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Uniqueness and regularity of flows of non-Newtonian fluids with critical power-law growth,"We deal with flows of non-Newtonian fluids in three-dimensional setting subjected to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.

"Community structure of insect herbivores is driven by conservatism, escalation and divergence of defensive traits in Ficus","Escalation (macroevolutionary increase) or divergence (disparity between relatives) in trait values are two frequent outcomes of the plant-herbivore arms race. We studied the defences and caterpillars associated with 21 sympatric New Guinean figs. Herbivore generalists were concentrated on hosts with low protease and oxidative activity. The distribution of specialists correlated with phylogeny, protease and trichomes. Additionally, highly specialised Asota moths used alkaloid rich plants. The evolution of proteases was conserved, alkaloid diversity has escalated across the studied species, oxidative activity has escalated within one clade, and trichomes have diverged across the phylogeny. Herbivore specificity correlated with their response to host defences: escalating traits largely affected generalists and divergent traits specialists, but the effect of escalating traits on extreme specialists was positive. In turn, the evolution of defences in Ficus can be driven towards both escalation and divergence in individual traits, in combination providing protection against a broad spectrum of herbivores.n",10618.0,"Volf, Martin:Segar, Simon Tristram:Miller, S.

Expanding and Contracting Coronal Loops as Evidence of Vortex Flows Induced by Solar Eruptions,"Eruptive solar flares were predicted to generate large-scale vortex flows at both sides of the erupting magnetic flux rope. This process is analogous to a well-known hydrodynamic process creating vortex rings. The vortices lead to advection of closed coronal loops located at the peripheries of the flaring active region. Outward flows are expected in the upper part and returning flows in the lower part of the vortex. Here, we examine two eruptive solar flares, the X1.1-class flare SOL2012-03-05T03: 20 and the C3.5-class SOL2013-06-19T07:29. In both flares, we find that the coronal loops observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly in its 171 angstrom, 193 angstrom, or 211 angstrom passbands show coexistence of expanding and contracting motions, in accordance with the model prediction. In the X-class flare, multiple expanding and contracting loops coexist for more than 35 minutes, while in the C-class flare, an expanding loop in 193 angstrom appears to be close by and cotemporal with an apparently imploding loop arcade seen in 171 angstrom. Later, the 193 angstrom loop also switches to contraction. These observations are naturally explained by vortex flows present in a model of eruptive solar flares.",10308.0,"Dudík, Jaroslav:Zuccarello, F.:Aulanier, G.:Schmieder, B.:Démoulin, P.",Astrophysical Journal,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Route to Superior Performance of a Nanoplasmonic Biosensor: Consideration of Both Photonic and Mass Transport Aspects,"Optical biosensors based on plasmonic nano structures present a promising alternative to conventional biosensing methods and provide unmatched possibilities for miniaturization and high-throughput analysis. Previous works on the topic, however, have been overwhelmingly directed toward elucidating the optical performance of such sensors, with little emphasis on the topic of mass transport. To date, there exists no examination, experimental nor theoretical, of the bioanalytical performance of such sensors (in terms of detection limits) that simultaneously addresses both optical and mass transport aspects in a quantitative manner. In this work we present a universal model that describes the smallest concentration that can be detected by a nanoplasmonic biosensor. Accounting for both optical and mass transport aspects, this model establishes a relationship between bioanalytical performance and the biosensor's design parameters. We employ the model to optimize the performance of a nanoplasmonic DNA biosensor consisting of randomly distributed gold nanorods on a glass substrate. Through both experimental and theoretical results, we show that the proper design of a nanostructured sensing substrate is one that maximizes mass transport efficiency while preserving the quality of the optical readout. All results are compared with those obtained using a conventional SPR biosensor. We show that an optimized nanoplasmonic substrate allows for the detection of DNA at concentrations of an order of magnitude lower with respect to an SPR biosensor",10610.0,"Špačková, Barbora:Lynn, Nicholas Scott:Slabý, Jiří:Šípová, Hana:Homola, Jiří",ACS Photonics,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The annual rate of kidney enlargement was reduced by 66% for bosutinib 200 mg/d versus placebo (1.63% versus 4.74%, respectively, P=0.01) and by 82% for pooled bosutinib versus placebo (0.84% versus 4.74%, respectively, P &lt, 0.001). Over the treatment period, patients receiving placebo or bosutinib had similar annualized eGFR decline. Gastrointestinal and liver-related adverse events were the most frequent toxicities.

Survival of syngeneic and allogeneic iPSC-derived neural precursors after spinal grafting in minipigs,"The use of autologous (or syngeneic) cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) holds great promise for future clinical use in a wide range of diseases and injuries. It is expected that cell replacement therapies using autologous cells would forego the need for immunosuppression, otherwise required in allogeneic transplantations. However, recent studies have shown the unexpected immune rejection of undifferentiated autologous mouse iPSCs after transplantation. Whether similar immunogenic properties are maintained in iPSC-derived lineage-committed cells (such as neural precursors) is relatively unknown. We demonstrate that syngeneic porcine iPSC-derived neural precursor cell (NPC) transplantation to the spinal cord in the absence of immunosuppression is associated with long-term survival and neuronal and glial differentiation. No tumor formation was noted. Similar cell engraftment and differentiation were shown in spinally injured transiently immunosuppressed swine leukocyte antigen (SLA)-mismatched allogeneic pigs. These data demonstrate that iPSC-NPCs can be grafted into syngeneic recipients in the absence of immunosuppression and that temporary immunosuppression is sufficient to induce long-term immune tolerance after NPC engraftment into spinally injured allogeneic recipients. Collectively, our results show that iPSC-NPCs represent an alternative source of transplantable NPCs for the treatment of a variety of disorders affecting the spinal cord, including trauma, ischemia, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",10601.0,"Strnádel, J.:Carromeu, C.:Bardy, C.:Navarro, M.:Platoshyn, O.:Glud, A.

Dark matter equation of state through cosmic history,"Cold dark matter is a crucial constituent of the current concordance cosmological model.

We test the inverse cosmic volume law for dark matter (DM) by allowing its EOS to vary independently in eight redshift bins in the range z=105 and z=0. We use the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation from the Planck satellite and supplement them with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the 6dF and SDSS-III BOSS surveys and with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) key project data. We find no evidence for nonzero EOS in any of the eight redshift bins. With Planck data alone, the DM abundance is most strongly constrained around matter-radiation equality ωgeq=0.1193-0.0035+0.0036 (95% C.L.), whereas its present-day value is more weakly constrained: ωg(0)=0.16-0.10+0.12 (95% C.L.).",10308.0,"Kopp, Michael:Skordis, Constantinos:Thomas, D.B.:Ilić, Stephane",Physical Review Letters,1,low,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Optoacoustic imaging combines the superb contrast of optical imaging with deep penetration of ultrasound, enabling a range of new applications. We used multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) for functional and structural neuroimaging in mice at resolution, depth, and specificity unattainable by other neuroimaging modalities. Based on multispectral readouts, we computed hemoglobin gradient and oxygen saturation changes related to processing of somatosensory signals in different structures along the entire subcortical-cortical axis. Using temporal correlation analysis and seed-based maps, we reveal the connectivity between cortical, thalamic, and sub-thalamic formations. With the same modality, high-resolution structural tomography of intact mouse brain was achieved based on endogenous contrasts, demonstrating near-perfect matches with anatomical features revealed by histology.

Late Palaeozoic palaeomagnetic and tectonic constraints for amalgamation of Pangea supercontinent in the European Variscan belt,"This paper provides a review of the evolution of palaeomagnetic directions and sequence of tectonic events in the European Variscan belt during Late Palaeozoic times. These data are correlated with palaeomagnetic records from Gondwana and Baltica in order to provide a large-scale geodynamic framework during the Carboniferous to Permian. The Early Carboniferous palaeomagnetic records reported mainly from the Rhenohercynian and Saxothuringian magmatic arcs indicate a 70° anticlockwise rotation, while Late Carboniferous to Permian magnetic directions from various rocks of western and central Europe are consistent with 120° clockwise rotation of the eastern and central parts of the Variscan belt. Our review of the chronology of tectonic events is based on a robust database of geochronologically constrained deformation, metamorphic and magmatic events, which allow discretizing the 80 Ma long orogenic evolution into five principal events. In this scenario, the Variscan belt can be regarded as a linear sub-plate, isolated from Gondwana and Laurussia by the Rhenohercynian and Palaeotethysian oceans during Devonian times. This linear composite belt was segmented by transform faults and boundaries in the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous times (360–335 Ma) during progressive E–W closure of Rhenohercynian ocean synchronously with collision between Saxothuringian and Moldanubian blocks. Subsequent relocation of subduction to the northern boundary Palaeotethysian ocean was responsible for N–S shortening almost orthogonal to the ancient sub-plate N–S elongation at around 335–325 Ma. This deformation resulted in dextral reactivation of transform boundaries associated with anticlockwise rotation of intermittent blocks. At the end of this rotation, the faults were parallelized to the Teysseire-Tornquist zone – the southern margin of Baltica, while the lozenge-shaped blocks of the former Variscan sub-plate were further shortened during continuous contraction. This evolution can fully explain the ≈ 70° anticlockwise rotation from Cn3 to Cn2 palaeomagnetic directions, which are regarded as successive Carboniferous magnetizations. Subsequently, the Variscan belt suffered a giant transtensional event from 325 to 310 Ma that was related to the development of extensional syn-magmatic core complexes over the whole belt and significant dextral reactivation of earlier NW–SE trending transform faults. This extensional event was associated with important tilts recorded by Cp magnetic overprint resulting from a major thermally induced remagnetization. During this event new sets of sinistral transfer NNE–SSW trending faults originated, that partly reactivated boundaries of the principal tectonic zones. Blocks delimited by second-order sinistral and first-order dextral faults, then rotated in a clockwise manner by ≈ 80°. The whole system subsequently suffered a period of NNE–SSW shortening that affected the Variscan belt namely along the former Laurussian and former Variscan sub-plate contact in the north and in the south, where the giant Cantabrian orocline developed at around 310–300 Ma due to hard collision with Gondwana. This deformation is associated with the clockwise rotation of Laurussia together with the accreted northern sector of the Variscan belt, and the anticlockwise of Gondwana. This clockwise 30° rotation is achieved by A1 remagnetizations, while the southern part of Iberia suffered anticlockwise rotation. The final stage of rapid clockwise rotation affecting the northern limb of the Iberian Arc including Corsica and Sardinia is attributed to giant N–S extension affecting the whole Variscan belt at the onset of Permo-Triassic opening of the Tethys ocean.",10505.0,"Lardeaux, Jean:Schulmann, Karel:Edel, Jean-Bernard:Lexa, Ondrej",Earth-Science Reviews,1,high,high,1,1,high,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mature dendritic cells correlate with favorable immune infiltrate and improved prognosis in ovarian carcinoma patients,"A high density of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and CD20(+) B cells correlates with prolonged survival in patients with a wide variety of human cancers, including high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC). However, the potential impact of mature dendritic cells (DCs) in shaping the immune contexture of HGSC, their role in the establishment of T cell-dependent antitumor immunity, and their potential prognostic value for HGSC patients remain unclear. We harnessed immunohistochemical tests and biomolecular analyses to demonstrate that a high density of tumor-infiltrating DC-LAMP(+) DCs is robustly associated with an immune contexture characterized by T(H)1 polarization and cytotoxic activity. We showed that both mature DCs and CD20(+) B cells play a critical role in the generation of a clinically-favorable cytotoxic immune response in HGSC microenvironment. In line with this notion, robust tumor infiltration by both DC-LAMP(+) DCs and CD20(+) B cells was associated with most favorable overall survival in two independent cohorts of chemotherapy-naive HGSC patients. Our findings suggest that the presence of mature, DC-LAMP(+) DCs in the tumor microenvironment may represent a novel, powerful prognostic biomarker for HGSC patients that reflects the activation of clinically-relevant anticancer immunity.",30204.0,"Truxová, Iva:Kašíková, Lenka:Hensler, Michal:Škapa, Petr:Laco, Jan:Pecen, Ladislav:Belicová, Lucie:Práznovec, Ivan:Halaška, Michael J.:Brtnický, Tomáš:Šálková, Eva:Rob, Lukáš:Kodet, Roman:Goc, Jeremy:Sautes-Fridman, Catherine:Fridman, Wolf Herman:Ryška, Aleš:Galluzzi, Lorenzo:Špíšek, Radek:Fučíková, Jitka",Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer,1,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Peripheral inflammation affects modulation of nociceptive synaptic transmission in the spinal cord induced by N‐arachidonoylphosphatidylethanolamine,"Endocannabinoids play an important role in modulating spinal nociceptive signalling, crucial for the development of pain. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor and the TRPV1 cation channel are both activated by the endocannabinoid anandamide, a product of biosynthesis from the endogenous lipid precursor N‐arachidonoylphosphatidylethanolamine (20:4‐NAPE). Here, we report CB1 receptor‐ and TRPV1‐mediated effects of 20:4‐NAPE on spinal synaptic transmission in control and inflammatory conditions. Spontaneous (sEPSCs) and dorsal root stimulation‐evoked (eEPSCs) excitatory postsynaptic currents from superficial dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices were assessed. Peripheral inflammation was induced by carrageenan. Anandamide concentration was assessed by mass spectrometry. While 20:4‐NAPE treatment inhibited the excitatory synaptic transmission in both naive and inflammatory conditions, peripheral inflammation altered the underlying mechanisms. Our data indicate that 20:4‐NAPE application induced mainly CB1 receptor‐mediated inhibitory effects in naive animals while TRPV1‐mediated mechanisms were also involved after inflammation. Increasing anandamide levels for analgesic purposes by applying substrate for its local synthesis may be more effective than systemic anandamide application or inhibition of its degradation.",30103.0,"Nerandžič, Vladimír:Mrózková, Petra:Adámek, Pavel:Špicarová, Diana:Nagy, I.:Paleček, Jiří",British Journal of Pharmacology,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Using process mining to analyze students' quiz-taking behavior patterns in a learning management system,"The aim of this paper is to explore students’ behavior and interaction patterns in different types of online quiz-based activities within learning management systems (LMS). Analyzing students’ behavior in online learning activities and detecting specific patterns of interaction in LMS is a topic of great interest for the educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) research communities. Previous studies have focused primarily on frequency analysis without addressing the temporal aspects of students’ learning behavior. Therefore, we apply a process-oriented approach, investigating perspectives on using process mining methods in the context of online learning and assessment. To explore a broad range of possible student behavior patterns, we analyze students’ interactions in several online quizzes from different courses and with different settings. Using process mining methods, we identify specific types of interaction sequences that shed new light on students’ quiz-taking strategies in LMS. We believe that these findings bring important implications for researchers studying student behavior in online environments as well as practitioners using online quizzes for learning and assessment.",50301.0,"Juhaňák, Libor:Zounek, Jiří:Rohlíková, Lucie",Computers in Human Behavior,1,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A genome sequence from a modern human skull over 45,000 years old from Zlatý kůň in Czechia","Modern humans expanded into Eurasia more than 40,000 years ago following their dispersal out of Africa. These Eurasians carried similar to 2-3% Neanderthal ancestry in their genomes, originating from admixture with Neanderthals that took place sometime between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, probably in the Middle East. In Europe, the modern human expansion preceded the disappearance of Neanderthals from the fossil record by 3,000-5,000 years. The genetic makeup of the first Europeans who colonized the continent more than 40,000 years ago remains poorly understood since few specimens have been studied. Here, we analyse a genome generated from the skull of a female individual from Zlaty kun, Czechia. We found that she belonged to a population that appears to have contributed genetically neither to later Europeans nor to Asians. Her genome carries similar to 3% Neanderthal ancestry, similar to those of other Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. However, the lengths of the Neanderthal segments are longer than those observed in the currently oldest modern human genome of the similar to 45,000-year-old Ust&apos,-Ishim individual from Siberia, suggesting that this individual from Zlaty Uri is one of the earliest Eurasian inhabitants following the expansion out of Africa.",10602.0,"Prüfer, Kay:Posth, Cosimo:Yu, He:Stoessel, Alexander:Spyrou, Maria A.:Deviese, Thibaut:Mattonai, Marco:Ribechini, Erika:Higham, Thomas:Velemínský, Petr:Brůžek, Jaroslav:Krause, Johannes","Nature Ecology &amp, Evolution",1,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Geo-economic variations in epidemiology, patterns of care, and outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: insights from the LUNG SAFE prospective cohort study","Background Little information is available about the geo-economic variations in demographics, management, and outcomes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We aimed to characterise the effect of these geo-economic variations in patients enrolled in the Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE). Methods LUNG SAFE was done during 4 consecutive weeks in winter, 2014, in a convenience sample of 459 intensive-care units in 50 countries across six continents. Inclusion criteria were admission to a participating intensive-care unit (including transfers) within the enrolment window and receipt of invasive or non-invasive ventilation. One of the trial&apos,s secondary aims was to characterise variations in the demographics, management, and outcome of patients with ARDS. We used the 2016 World Bank countries classification to define three major geo-economic groupings, namely European high-income countries (Europe-High), high-income countries in the rest of the world (rWORLD-High), and middle-income countries (Middle). We compared patient outcomes across these three groupings. LUNG SAFE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02010073. Findings Of the 2813 patients enrolled in LUNG SAFE who fulfilled ARDS criteria on day 1 or 2, 1521 (54%) were recruited from Europe-High, 746 (27%) from rWORLD-High, and 546 (19%) from Middle countries. We noted significant geographical variations in demographics, risk factors for ARDS, and comorbid diseases. The proportion of patients with severe ARDS or with ratios of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (FIO2) less than 150 was significantly lower in rWORLD-High countries than in the two other regions. Use of prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade was significantly more common in Europe-High countries than in the other two regions. Adjusted duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive-care unit were significantly shorter in patients in rWORLD-High countries than in Europe-High or Middle countries. High gross national income per person was associated with increased survival in ARDS, hospital survival was significantly lower in Middle countries than in Europe-High or rWORLD-High countries.

Molecular basis of the 14-3-3 protein-dependent activation of yeast neutral trehalase Nth1,"The 14-3-3 proteins, a family of highly conserved scaffolding proteins ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic cells, interact with and regulate the function of several hundreds of partner proteins. Yeast neutral trehalases (Nth), enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of trehalose to glucose, compared with trehalases from other organisms, possess distinct structure and regulation involving phosphorylation at multiple sites followed by binding to the 14-3-3 protein. Here we report the crystal structures of yeast Nth1 and its complex with Bmh1 (yeast 14-3-3 isoform), which, together with mutational and fluorescence studies, indicate that the binding of Nth1 by 14-33 triggers Nth1&apos,s activity by enabling the proper 3D configuration of Nth1&apos,s catalytic and calcium-binding domains relative to each other, thus stabilizing the flexible part of the active site required for catalysis. The presented structure of the Bmh1: Nth1 complex highlights the ability of 14-3-3 to modulate the structure of a multidomain binding partner and to function as an allosteric effector. Furthermore, comparison of the Bmh1: Nth1 complex structure with those of 14-3-3: serotonin N-acetyltransferase and 14-3-3: heat shock protein beta-6 complexes revealed similarities in the 3D structures of bound partner proteins, suggesting the highly conserved nature of 14-3-3 affects the structures of many client proteins.",10600.0,"Alblová, Miroslava:Šmídová, Aneta:Dočekal, Vojtěch:Veselý, Jan:Heřman, Petr:Obšilová, Veronika:Obšil, Tomáš",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1,high,high,0,0,high,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To facilitate this while preserving visual quality, we developed a new type of guidance for state-of-art patch-based synthesis, that can be applied to any type of video content and does not require any additional information besides the video itself and a user-speci ed mask of the region to be stylized.

Global hotspots and correlates of alien species richness across taxonomic groups,"Human-mediated transport beyond biogeographic barriers has led to the introduction and establishment of alien species in new regions worldwide. However, we lack a global picture of established alien species richness for multiple taxonomic groups. Here, we assess global patterns and potential drivers of established alien species richness across eight taxonomic groups (amphib¬ians, ants, birds, freshwater fishes, mammals, vascular plants, reptiles and spiders) for 186 islands and 423 mainland regions. Hotspots of established alien species richness are predominantly island and coastal mainland regions. Regions with greater gross domestic product per capita, human population density, and area have higher established alien richness, with strongest effects emerging for islands. Ants and reptiles, birds and mammals, and vascular plants and spiders form pairs of taxonomic groups with the highest spatial congruence in established alien richness, but drivers explaining richness differ between the taxa in each pair.

Gene fragmentation and RNA editing without borders: eccentric mitochondrial genomes of diplonemids,"Diplonemids are highly abundant heterotrophic marine protists. Previous studies showed that their strikingly bloated mitochondrial genome is unique because of systematic gene fragmentation and manifold RNA editing. Here we report a comparative study of mitochondrial genome architecture, gene structure and RNA editing of six recently isolated, phylogenetically diverse diplonemid species. Mitochondria) gene fragmentation and modes of RNA editing, which include cytidine-to-uridine (C-to-U) and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) substitutions and 3&apos, uridine additions (U-appendage), are conserved across diplonemids. Yet as we show here, all these features have been pushed to their extremes in the Hemistasiidae lineage. For example, Namystynia karyoxenos has its genes fragmented into more than twice as many modules than other diplonemids, with modules as short as four nucleotides. Furthermore, we detected in this group multiple A-appendage and guanosine-to-adenosine (G-to-A) substitution editing events not observed before in diplonemids and found very rarely elsewhere. With &gt,1,000 sites, C-to-U and A-to-I editing in Namystynia is nearly 10 times more frequent than in other diplonemids. The editing density of 12% in coding regions makes Namystynia&apos,s the most extensively edited transcriptome described so far.

Does First-Trimester Screening Modify the Natural History of Congenital Heart Disease? Analysis of Outcome of Regional Cardiac Screening at 2 Different Time Periods,"BACKGROUND: The study analyzed the impact of first-trimester screening on the spectrum of congenital heart defects (CHDs) later in pregnancy and on the outcome of fetuses and children born alive with a CHD. METHODS: The spectrum of CHDs, associated comorbidities, and outcome of fetuses, either diagnosed with a CHD in the first trimester (Group I, 127 fetuses) or only in the second-trimester screening (Group II, 344 fetuses), were analyzed retrospectively between 2007 and 2013. Second-trimester fetuses diagnosed with a CHD between 2007 and 2013 were also compared with Group III (532 fetuses diagnosed with a CHD in the second trimester from 1996 to 2001, the period before first-trimester screening was introduced). RESULTS: The spectrum of CHDs diagnosed in the first and second trimesters in the same time period differed significantly, with a greater number of comorbidities (P&lt, 0.0001), CHDs with univentricular outcome (P&lt, 0.0001), intrauterine deaths (P= 0.01), and terminations of pregnancy (P&lt, 0.0001) in Group I compared with Group II. In Group III, significantly more cases of CHDs with univentricular outcome (P&lt, 0.0001), intrauterine demise (P= 0.036), and early termination (P&lt, 0.0001) were identified compared with fetuses diagnosed with CHDs in the second trimester between 2007 and 2013.

"Mitochondrial Phylogenomics Resolves the Global Spread of Higher Termites, Ecosystem Engineers of the Tropics","The higher termites (Termitidae) are keystone species and ecosystem engineers. They have exceptional biomass and play important roles in decomposition of dead plant matter, in soil manipulation, and as the primary food for many animals, especially in the tropics. Higher termites are most diverse in rainforests, with estimated origins in the late Eocene (similar to 54 Ma), postdating the breakup of Pangaea and Gondwana when most continents became separated. Since termites are poor fliers, their origin and spread across the globe requires alternative explanation. Here, we show that higher termites originated 42-54Ma in Africa and subsequently underwent at least 24 dispersal events between the continents in two main periods. Using phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial genomes from 415 species, including all higher termite taxonomic and feeding groups, we inferred 10 dispersal events to South America and Asia 35-23Ma, coinciding with the sharp decrease in global temperature, sea level, and rainforest co",10608.0,"Bourguignon, Thomas:Nathan, Lo:Šobotník, Jan:Ho, Simon:Iqbal, Naeem:Coissac, Eric:Lee, Maria:Jendryka, Martin M.:Sillam-Dusses, David:Křížková, Barbora:Roisin, Yves:Evans, Theodore A.",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Observation of a large-scale anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays above 8 x 10(18) eV,"Cosmic rays are atomic nuclei arriving from outer space that reach the highest energies observed in nature. Clues to their origin come from studying the distribution of their arrival directions. Using 3 x 10(4) cosmic rays with energies above 8 x 10(18) electron volts, recorded with the Pierre Auger Observatory from a total exposure of 76,800 km(2) sr year, we determined the existence of anisotropy in arrival directions. The anisotropy, detected at more than a 5.2s level of significance, can be described by a dipole with an amplitude of 6:5(-0.9)(+1.3) percent toward right ascension alpha(d) = 100 +/- 10 degrees and declination delta(d) = -24(-13)(+12) degrees.

Adolescents’ Intense and Problematic Social Media Use and Their Well-Being in 29 Countries,"Purpose: This study examined (1) whether intense and problematic social media use (SMU) were independently associated with adolescent well-being, (2) whether these associations varied by the country-level prevalence of intense and problematic SMU, and (3) whether differences in the country-level prevalence of intense and problematic SMU were related to differences in mobile Internet access. Methods: Individual-level data came from 154,981 adolescents (meanage ¼ 13.5) from 29 countries that participated in the 2017/2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. Intense SMU was measured by the time spent on social media, whereas problematic SMU was defined by symptoms of addiction to social media. Mental (life satisfaction and psychological complaints), school (school satisfaction and perceived school pressure), and social (family support and friend support) well-being were assessed. Country-level data came from aggregated individual-level data and data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on Internet access. Results: Two-level regression analyses indicated that in countries with a lower prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported lower levels of life satisfaction and family support and more psychological complaints than nonintense users. In contrast, in countries with a higher prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported higher levels of family support and life satisfaction than nonintense users, and similar levels of psychological complaints. In all countries, intense users reported more friend support than nonintense users. The findings regarding problematic SMU were more consistent: In all countries, problematic users reported lower well-being on all domains than nonproblematic users. Observed differences in country-level prevalence rates of intense and problematic SMU could not be explained by mobile Internet access. Conclusions: Adolescents reporting problematic SMU are particularly at risk of lower well-being. In many countries, intense SMU may be a normative adolescent behavior that contributes positively to specific domains of their well-being.",30304.0,"Boer, Maartje:van den Eijnden, Regina J. J.

CRMP2 mediates Sema3F‐dependent axon pruning and dendritic spine remodeling,"Regulation of axon guidance and pruning of inappropriate synapses by class 3 semaphorins are key to the development of neural circuits. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) has been shown to regulate axon guidance by mediating semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) signaling, however, nothing is known about its role in synapse pruning. Here, using newly generated crmp2−/− mice we demonstrate that CRMP2 has a moderate effect on Sema3A‐dependent axon guidance in vivo, and its deficiency leads to a mild defect in axon guidance in peripheral nerves and the corpus callosum. Surprisingly, crmp2−/− mice display prominent defects in stereotyped axon pruning in hippocampus and visual cortex and altered dendritic spine remodeling, which is consistent with impaired Sema3F signaling and with models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We demonstrate that CRMP2 mediates Sema3F signaling in primary neurons and that crmp2−/− mice display ASD‐related social behavior changes in the early postnatal period as well as in adults. Together, we demonstrate that CRMP2 mediates Sema3F‐dependent synapse pruning and its dysfunction shares histological and behavioral features of ASD.",30103.0,"Žiak, Jakub:Weissová, Romana:Jeřábková, Kateřina:Janíková, Martina:Maimon, R.:Petrásek, Tomáš:Pukajová, Barbora:Kleisnerová, Marie:Wang, M.:Brill, M.

What lessons can we learn from a comparative analysis of these experiments? This paper seeks to draw generic lessons not from what has gone wrong but from national case studies that stand out in a best way. Through a European academic network, we have selected and analysed 51 'smart practice' case studies of renewable energy development from 20 countries. We present the outcomes of both qualitative and quantitative analysis of these case studies (smart practice criteria) and discuss a set of generic findings concerning specific types of smart practices and problems of potential transferability of projects to other regions.

"The impact of substituting soybean meal and sunflower meal with a mixture of white lupine seeds and rapeseed meal on rabbit doe milk yield and composition, and the growth performance and carcass traits of their litters","The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of substitution of soybean meal (SBM) and sunflower meal (SFM) with a mixture of whole white lupine seeds (WLS) and rapeseed meal (RSM) in lactation and growing diets on the milk yield and composition of rabbit does, as well as on the performance of their litters. Two lactation diets and two growing diets having identical ratios of digestible protein to digestible energy were formulated. The first lactation diet (SSL) contained 13.0% SBM and 5.0% SFM as the main crude protein (CP) sources, whereas the second lactation diet (RLL) was based on 10.0% RSM and 14.0% WLS. The first growing diet (SSG) included 7.0% SBM as the main CP source, whereas the second growing diet (RLG) diet was based on 6.0% RSM and 4.0% WLS. A total of 32 crossbred rabbit does (Hyplus PS 19 strain) were divided into 2 experimental treatments (16 each) and were fed one of the two lactation diets. All does were in the fourth parturition cycle. The litters (PS Hyplus 19×PS Hyplus 40) were standardized to 9 kits on the day of birth (Day 0). The litters were offered one of the two growing diets ad libitum from d 17 to d 33 (weaning) of age. At weaning, 10 litters/diet (a total of 90 animals of both sexes) were randomly chosen for the fattening period. Rabbits continued to be fed their respective growing diets ad libitum for 42 d. No significant differences were observed between treatments in terms of the body weight, feed intake or milk production of rabbit does during the entire lactation period. Interestingly, substituting the SSL diet with the RLL diet modified the fatty acid (FA) profile of milk fat, specifically, total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) were significantly increased, thus tending to increase the total ratio of n-3PUFA to C20:4n-6 (P=0.067) in the milk of does fed the RLL diet. The RLL diet increased milk content of alpha-linolenic acid (P=0.037) and eicosapentaenoic acid (P=0.015). The performance of fattening rabbits was not affected by dietary treatments. It could be concluded that substitution of SBM and SFM with a mixture of WLS and RSM increased the milk content of n-3PUFA and had no adverse effects on the performance or milk yield of rabbit does or on the performance, carcass traits or viability of their litters.",40201.0,"Volek, Zdeněk:Uhlířová, Linda",Animal Feed Science and Technology,1,low,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

Ultrapure Graphene Is a Poor Electrocatalyst: Definitive Proof of the Key Role of Metallic Impurities in Graphene-Based Electrocatalysis,"Graphene and its derivatives have been reported in many articles as &quot,metal-free&quot, carbon electrocatalytic materials.

These impurities can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity and thus lead to data misinterpretation, such impure samples are referred to as &quot,metal-free&quot, catalysts. In this paper, we report the synthesis of impurity-free graphene, which is compared with graphene prepared by standard methods based on the thermal and chemical reduction of two graphene oxides.

Protection of Arabidopsis Blunt-Ended Telomeres Is Mediated by a Physical Association with the Ku Heterodimer,"Telomeres form specialized chromatin that protects natural chromosome termini from being recognized as DNA double-strand breaks. Plants possess unusual blunt-ended telomeres that are unable to form t-loops or complex with single-strand DNA binding proteins, raising the question of the mechanism behind their protection. We have previously suggested that blunt-ended telomeres in Arabidopsis thaliana are protected by Ku, a DNA repair factor with a high affinity for DNA ends. In nonhomologous end joining, Ku loads onto broken DNA via a channel consisting of positively charged amino acids. Here, we demonstrate that while association of Ku with plant telomeres also depends on this channel, Ku's requirements for DNA binding differ between DNA repair and telomere protection. We show that a Ku complex proficient in DNA loading but impaired in translocation along DNA is able to protect blunt-ended telomeres but is deficient in DNA repair. This suggests that Ku physically sequesters blunt-ended telomeres within its DNA binding channel, shielding them from other DNA repair machineries.",10611.0,"Valuchová, Soňa:Fulneček, Jaroslav:Prokop, Zbyněk:Stolt-Bergner, Peggy:Janoušková, Eliška:Hofr, Ctirad:Říha, Karel",Plant Cell,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Operando Imaging of All-Electric Spin Texture Manipulation in Ferroelectric and Multiferroic Rashba Semiconductors,"The control of the electron spin by external means is a key issue for spintronic devices.

Intrinsically disordered proteins drive enamel formation via an evolutionarily conserved self-assembly motif,"The formation of mineralized tissues is governed by extracellular matrix proteins that assemble into a 3D organic matrix directing the deposition of hydroxyapatite. Although the formation of bones and dentin depends on the self-assembly of type I collagen via the Gly-X-Y motif, the molecular mechanism by which enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) assemble into the organic matrix remains poorly understood. Here we identified a Y/F-x-x-Y/L/F-x-Y/F motif, evolutionarily conserved from the first tetrapods to man, that is crucial for higher order structure self-assembly of the key intrinsically disordered EMPs, ameloblastin and amelogenin. Using targeted mutations in mice and high-resolution imaging, we show that impairment of ameloblastin self-assembly causes disorganization of the enamel organic matrix and yields enamel with disordered hydroxyapatite crystallites.

Fully probabilistic design of hierarchical Bayesian models,"The minimum cross-entropy principle is an established technique for design of an un- known distribution, processing linear functional constraints on the distribution. More generally, fully probabilistic design (FPD) chooses the distribution-within the knowledge-constrained set of possible distributions-for which the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the designer’s ideal distribution is minimized. These principles treat the unknown distribution deterministically. In this paper, fully probabilistic design is applied to hierarchical Bayesian models for the first time, yielding optimal design of a (possibly nonparametric) stochastic model for the unknown distribution. This equips minimum cross-entropy and FPD distributional estimates with measures of uncertainty. It enables robust choice of the optimal model, as well as randomization of this choice. The ability to process non-linear functional constraints in the constructed distribution significantly extends the applicability of these principles.",0.0,"Quinn, A.:Kárný, Miroslav:Guy, Tatiana Valentine",Information Sciences,1,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Application of the DETECT algorithm for detection of risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis: data from a Czech tertiary centre,"Objective. The early, simple and reliable detection of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in SSc (DETECT) study described a new algorithm for early detection of PAH in patients with SSc. The aim of this retrospective, single-centre, cross-sectional study was to apply a modified DETECT calculator in patients with SSc in the East Bohemian region, Czech Republic, to assess the risk of PAH and to compare these results with PAH screening based on the European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) 2009 guidelines. Methods. Sixty patients were recruited with a diagnosis of SSc (according to ACR criteria), aged 27-78 years. A modified DETECT algorithm using the modified parameter of (1.4 x right ventricle diameter)2 in place of right atrium area was applied to all patients. Right heart catheterization (RHC) was performed in all patients with an estimated (by echocardiography) increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure >=50 mm Hg in accordance with the ESC/ERS guidelines, however, RHC was not performed in patients solely recommended for RHC using the modified DETECT algorithm. Results. Using the modified DETECT calculator, 24/58 (41.4%) patients were recommended for RHC, compared with 14/58 (24.1%) when applying the ESC/ERS 2009 guidelines. PAH was diagnosed in 7/58 (12.1%) patients. During follow-up, PAH was diagnosed in six patients. Of these, four were modified DETECT score-positive for 2 years and all for 1 year before PAH diagnosis. Conclusion. The modified DETECT algorithm detects all patients with PAH diagnosed according to ECS/ERS 2009 guidelines and RHC. Data of the 2-year follow-up indicate a possible positive predictive role for the modified DETECT calculator.",0.0,"Soukup, Tomáš:Pudil, Radek:Kubínová, Kateřina:Hromádková, Lucie:Dušek, Jaroslav:Tošovský, Marian:Bradna, Petr:Hrnčíř, Zbyněk:Bureš, Jan",Rheumatology,1,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Endoscopic or surgical myotomy in patients with idiopathic achalasia,"BACKGROUND: Pneumatic dilation and laparoscopic Heller&apos,s myotomy (LHM) are established treatments for idiopathic achalasia. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a less invasive therapy with promising early study results. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized trial, we compared POEM with LHM plus Dor&apos,s fundoplication in patients with symptomatic achalasia. The primary end point was clinical success, defined as an Eckardt symptom score of 3 or less (range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms of achalasia) without the use of additional treatments, at the 2-year follow-up, a noninferiority margin of -12.5 percentage points was used in the primary analysis. Secondary end points included adverse events, esophageal function, Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score (range, 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating better function), and gastroesophageal reflux. RESULTS: A total of 221 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either POEM (112 patients) or LHM plus Dor&apos,s fundoplication (109 patients). Clinical success at the 2-year follow-up was observed in 83.0% of patients in the POEM group and 81.7% of patients in the LHM group (difference, 1.4 percentage points, 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.7 to 11.4, P = 0.007 for noninferiority). Serious adverse events occurred in 2.7% of patients in the POEM group and 7.3% of patients in the LHM group. Improvement in esophageal function from baseline to 24 months, as assessed by measurement of the integrated relaxation pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter, did not differ significantly between the treatment groups (difference, -0.75 mm Hg, 95% CI, -2.26 to 0.76), nor did improvement in the score on the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (difference, 0.14 points, 95% CI, -4.01 to 4.28). At 3 months, 57% of patients in the POEM group and 20% of patients in the LHM group had reflux esophagitis, as assessed by endoscopy, at 24 months, the corresponding percentages were 44% and 29%. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial, POEM was noninferior to LHM plus Dor&apos,s fundoplication in controlling symptoms of achalasia at 2 years. Gastroesophageal reflux was more common among patients who underwent POEM than among those who underwent LHM.

Decoding the Transcriptional Response to Ischemic Stroke in Young and Aged Mouse Brain,"Ischemic stroke is a well-recognized disease of aging, yet it is unclear how the age-dependent vulnerability occurs and what are the underlying mechanisms. To address these issues, we perform a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis of aging, ischemic stroke, and their interaction in 3- and 18-month-old mice. We assess differential gene expression across injury status and age, estimate cell type proportion changes, assay the results against a range of transcriptional signatures from the literature, and perform unsupervised co-expression analysis, identifying modules of genes with varying response to injury. We uncover downregulation of axonal and synaptic maintenance genetic program, and increased activation of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling following stroke in aged mice.

Imprints of primordial non-Gaussianity on gravitational wave spectrum,"Although cosmic microwave background and large scale structure probe the largest scales of our Universe with ever-increasing precision, our knowledge about the smaller scales is still very limited other than the bounds on primordial black holes (PBHs). We show that the statistical properties of the small scale quantum fluctuations can be probed via the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which is induced as the scalar modes reenter the horizon. We found that even if scalar curvature fluctuations have a subdominant non-Gaussian component, these non-Gaussian perturbations can source a dominant portion of the induced GWs. Moreover, the GWs sourced by non-Gaussian scalar fluctuations peak at a higher frequency and this can result in distinctive observational signatures.",10308.0,"Unal, Caner",Physical Review D,1,high,high,1,0,medium,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To explore a broad range of possible student behavior patterns, we analyze students’ interactions in several online quizzes from different courses and with different settings.

Can war foster cooperation?,"In the past decade, nearly 20 studies have found a strong, persistent pattern in surveys and behavioral experiments from over 40 countries: individual exposure to war violence tends to increase social cooperation at the local level, including community participation and prosocial behavior. Thus while war has many negative legacies for individuals and societies, it appears to leave a positive legacy in terms of local cooperation and civic engagement. We discuss, synthesize, and reanalyze the emerging body of evidence and weigh alternative explanations.

Developmental variability channels mouse molar evolution,"Do developmental systems preferentially produce certain types of variation that orient phenotypic evolution along preferred directions? At different scales, from the intra-population to the interspecific, the murine first upper molar shows repeated anterior elongation. Using a novel quantitative approach to compare the development of two mouse strains with short or long molars, we identified temporal, spatial and functional differences in tooth signaling center activity, that arise from differential tuning of the activation-inhibition mechanisms underlying tooth patterning. By tracing their fate, we could explain why only the upper first molar reacts via elongation of its anterior part. Despite a lack of genetic variation, individuals of the elongated strain varied in tooth length and the temporal dynamics of their signaling centers, highlighting the intrinsic instability of the upper molar developmental system. Collectively, these results reveal the variational properties of murine molar development that drive morphological evolution along a line of least resistance.",30106.0,"Hayden, Luke:Lochovská, Kateřina:Sémon, Marie:Renaud, Sabrina:Delignette-Muller, Marie-Laure:Vilcot, Maurine:Peterková, Renata:Hovořáková, Mária:Pantalacci, Sophie",eLife,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A note on locking materials and gradient polyconvexity,"We use gradient Young measures generated by Lipschitz maps to define a relaxation of integral functionals which are allowed to attain the value +infinity and can model ideal locking in elasticity as defined by Prager in 1957. Furthermore, we show the existence of minimizers for variational problems for elastic materials with energy densities that can be expressed in terms of a function being continuous in the deformation gradient and convex in the gradient of the cofactor (and possibly also the gradient of the determinant) of the corresponding deformation gradient. We call the related energy functional gradient polyconvex. Thus, instead of considering second derivatives of the deformation gradient as in second-grade materials, only a weaker higher integrability is imposed. Although the second-order gradient of the deformation is not included in our model, gradient polycon- vex functionals allow for an implicit uniform positive lower bound on the determinant of the deformation gradient on the closure of the domain representing the elastic body. Consequently, the material does not allow for extreme local compression.",10102.0,"Benešová, B.:Kružík, Martin:Schloemerkemper, A.",Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences,1,high,high,1,0,high,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Simultaneous Detection of Cu2+ and Hg2+ via Two Mutually Independent Sensing Pathways of Biimidazole Push-Pull Dye,"An easy-to-synthesize, biimidazole push-pull dye has been designed, comprising two mutually independent analyte binding sites. It has been found that Hg2+ coordinates with the compound via thiophene residue and inhibits the charge-transfer (CT) process, which transforms the yellow-colored solution colorless. On the other hand, an unusually large bathochromic shift is observed in CT band upon addition of Cu2+, accompanied by a change in the color from yellow to red. A rather surprising observation is made from mechanistic studies, where it indicates that Cu2+ catalyzes the formation of 6-imino-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-d]imidazole-4(3H)-one (IPIMO) derivative. This strongly affects the charge-transfer state of the compound as well as its polarizability. Most importantly, this is the first report where IPIMO formation reaction has been exploited for sensing of a metal ion. Further, the system was employed for screening of both of these metal ions in wastewater samples. Recovery values ranging from 93.3 to 105.0% confirm the suitability of the present method for estimating trace level of metal ions in complex matrices.

We shall consider asymptotically flat black hole in the Einstein-Lovelock theory, find analytical expressions for gravitational quasinormal modes in the eikonal regime and analyze the null geodesics. Comparison of the both phenomena shows that the expected link between the null geodesics and quasinormal modes is violated in the Einstein-Lovelock theory.

These models predict that bound remnants survive such events with, according to some simulations, a high kick velocity. We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass white dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic escape velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass elements.

Tree rings reveal globally coherent signature of cosmogenic radiocarbon events in 774 and 993 CE,"Though tree-ring chronologies are annually resolved, their dating has never been independently validated at the global scale. Moreover, it is unknown if atmospheric radiocarbon enrichment events of cosmogenic origin leave spatiotemporally consistent fingerprints. Here we measure the C-14 content in 484 individual tree rings formed in the periods 770-780 and 990-1000 CE. Distinct C-14 excursions starting in the boreal summer of 774 and the boreal spring of 993 ensure the precise dating of 44 tree-ring records from five continents. We also identify a meridional decline of 11-year mean atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations across both hemispheres. Corroborated by historical eye-witness accounts of red auroras, our results suggest a global exposure to strong solar proton radiation.

"Evolutionary, Cognitive, and Contextual Approaches to the Study of Religious Systems: A Proposition of Synthesis","The explanatory gap between the life sciences and the humanities that is present in the study of human phenomena impedes productive interdisciplinary examination that such a complex subject requires. Manifested as epistemological tensions over reductionism vs. holism, nature vs. nurture, and the study of micro vs. macro context, the divergent research approaches in the humanities and the sciences produce separate bodies of knowledge that are difficult to reconcile. To remedy this incommensurability, the article proposes to employ the complex adaptive systems approach, which allows to study specific cultural systems in their ecologies and to account for the myriads of factors that constitute such systems, including nonlinear interactions between these factors and their evolution. On a specific example of religious systems, we show that by studying cultural systems in their contextual variability, mechanistic composition, and evolutionary history, the humanities and the sciences should be able to fruitfully collaborate while avoiding previous pitfalls of excessive reductionism, genetic determinism, and sweeping overgeneralizations, on the one hand, and pitfalls of excessive holism, cultural determinism, and aversion to any generalizations, on the other hand.",60304.0,"Lang, Martin:Kundt, Radek",Method and Theory in the Study of Religion.

Deazaflavin reductive photocatalysis involves excited semiquinone radicals,"Flavin-mediated photocatalytic oxidations are established in synthetic chemistry. In contrast, their use in reductive chemistry is rare. Deazaflavins with a much lower reduction potential are even better suited for reductive chemistry rendering also deazaflavin semiquinones as strong reductants. However, no direct evidence exists for the involvement of these radical species in reductive processes. Here, we synthesise deazaflavins with different substituents at C5 and demonstrate their photocatalytic activity in the dehalogenation of p-halogenanisoles with best performance under basic conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal a consecutive photo-induced electron transfer via the semiquinone form of the deazaflavin as part of a triplet-correlated radical pair after electron transfer from a sacrificial electron donor to the triplet state. A second electron transfer from the excited semiquinone to p-halogenanisoles triggers the final product formation. This study provides first evidence that the reductive power of excited deazaflavin semiquinones can be used in photocatalytic reductive chemistry. © 2020, The Author(s).",10401.0,"Graml, A.:Neveselý, Tomáš:Jan, Kutta R.:Cibulka, Radek:König, B.",Nature Communications,1,high,high,0,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion Fundamentally Requires H(2)O(2)Signaling by NADPH Oxidase 4,"NADPH facilitates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic islets (PIs) of beta-cells through an as yet unknown mechanism. We found NADPH oxidase isoform 4 (NOX4) to be the main producer of cytosolic H2O2, which is essential for GSIS, an increase in ATP alone was insufficient for GSIS. The fast GSIS phase was absent from PIs from NOX4-null, beta-cell-specific knockout mice (NOX4 beta KO) (though not from NOX2 knockout mice) and from NOX4-silenced or catalase-overexpressing INS-1E cells. Lentiviral NOX4 overexpression or H(2)O(2)rescued GSIS in PIs from NOX4 beta KO mice. NOX4 silencing suppressed Ca(2+)oscillations, and the patch-clamped K(ATP)channel opened more frequently when glucose was high. Mitochondrial H2O2, decreasing upon GSIS, provided alternative redox signaling when 2-oxo-isocaproate or fatty acid oxidation formed superoxides through electron-transfer flavoprotein:Q-oxidoreductase. Unlike GSIS, such insulin secretion was blocked with mitochondrial antioxidant SkQ1. Both NOX4 knockout and NOX4 beta KO mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and peripheral insulin resistance. Thus, the redox signaling previously suggested to cause beta-cells to self-check hypothetically induces insulin resistance when it is absent. In conclusion, increases in ATP and H(2)O(2)constitute an essential signal that switches on insulin exocytosis for glucose and branched-chain oxoacids as secretagogues (it does so partially for fatty acids). Redox signaling could be impaired by cytosolic antioxidants, hence, those targeting mitochondria should be preferred for clinical applications to treat (pre)diabetes at any stage.",30202.0,"Plecitá-Hlavatá, Lydie:Jabůrek, Martin:Holendová, Blanka:Tauber, Jan:Pavluch, Vojtěch:Berková, Z.:Cahová, M.:Schröder, K.:Brandes, R.

Resolving the taxonomy of emerging zoonotic pathogens in the Trichophyton benhamiae complex,"Species of the Trichophyton benhamiae complex are predominantly zoophilic pathogens with a worldwide distribution. These pathogens have recently become important due to their epidemic spread in pets and pet owners. Considerable genetic and phenotypic variability has been revealed in these emerging pathogens, but the species limits and host spectra have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we used an approach combining phylogenetic analysis based on four loci, population-genetic data, phenotypic and physiological analysis, mating type gene characterization and ecological data to resolve the taxonomy of these pathogens. This approach supported the inclusion of nine taxa in the complex, including three new species and one new variety. Trichophyton benhamiae var. luteum var. nov. (´yellow phenotype´ strains) is currently a major cause of zoonotic tinea corporis and capitis in Europe (mostly transmitted from guinea pigs). The isolates of the ´white phenotype´ do not form a monophyletic group and are segregated into three taxa, T. benhamiae var. benhamiae (mostly North America, dogs), T. europaeum sp. nov. (mostly Europe, guinea pigs), and T. japonicum sp. nov. (predominant in East Asia but also found in Europe, rabbits and guinea pigs). The new species T. africanum sp. nov. is proposed for the ´African´ race of T. benhamiae. The introduction to new geographic areas and host jump followed by extinction of one mating type gene have played important roles in the evolution of these pathogens. Due to considerable phenotypic similarity of many dermatophytes and phenomena such as incomplete lineage sorting or occasional hybridization and introgression, we demonstrate the need to follow polyphasic approach in species delimitation. Neutrally evolving and noncoding DNA regions showed significantly higher discriminatory power compared to conventional protein-coding loci. Diagnostic options for species identification in practice based on molecular markers, phenotype and MALDI-TOF spectra are presented.

A 60 million year record of continental back-arc cyclic melting,"Continental crust forms and evolves above subduction zones as a result of heat and mass transfer from the mantle below. The nature and extent of this transfer remain debated. While it has been recognized that arc magmatism at active continental margins can be cyclical at 50 to 1 Myr timescales, such cyclicity has not been recognized in the back-arc. Here we investigate the melting of sedimentary rocks in the continental back-arc of the western Gondwana margin during the Cambrian–Ordovician Famatinian mountain building process (orogeny) of NW Argentina. New LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age of zircons that formed during crustal melting, range from 505 to 440 Ma, concentrated into age groups spaced by 10-15 Myr. This suggests multiple and cyclical melting events in the continental back-arc, which matches the > 60 Myr duration of the magmatic activity in the arc and demonstrates that thermal and magmatic cyclicity extends also to the continental hinterland. We conclude that back-arc melting reflects a long-lasting, pulsating, cyclical heat transfer from mantle to crust that leads to thorough crustal reworking, transforming sedimentary rocks into crystalline continental crust. Thus, while magma transfer from the mantle promotes crustal growth in convergent margins, cyclical melting promotes crustal maturation of the back-arc.",10505.0,"Hasalová, Pavlína:Míková, Jitka:Wolfram, Lauren:Weinberg, Roberto:Nebel, Oliver:Hamza, Kais:Becchio, Raul",Nature Geoscience,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Substitution-Inert Polynuclear Platinum Complexes That Inhibit the Activity of DNA Polymerase in Triplex-Forming Templates,"The formation of triple-helical DNA is implicated in the regulation of gene expression. The triplexes are, however, unstable under physiological conditions so that effective stabilizers for the triplex formation are needed. Herein, we describe a new strategy for the stabilization of such triplexes that is based on antitumor substitution-inert polynuclear platinum complexes (SI-PPCs). These compounds were previously shown to bind to DNA through the phosphate clampa discrete mode of DNA-ligand recognition distinct from the canonical intercalation and minor-groove binding. We have found that SI-PPCs efficiently inhibit DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase in sequences prone to the formation of pyrimidine- and purine-motif triplex DNAs. Moreover, the results suggest that SI-PPCs are able to induce the formation of triple-helical DNA between duplexes and strands that are not completely complementary to each other. Collectively, these data provide evidence that SI-PPCs are very efficient stabilizers of triple-stranded DNA that might exert their action by stabilizing higher-order structures such as triple-helical DNA.",10401.0,"Malina, Jaroslav:Farrell, N.P.:Brabec, Viktor",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,1,high,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Electric-field enhanced reactivity and migration of iron nanoparticles with implications for groundwater treatment technologies: Proof of concept,"The extensive use of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) particles for groundwater treatment has been limited, in part, because of their non-selective reactivity and low mobility in aquatic environments. Herein, we describe and explore progressive changes in the reactivity and migration of aqueous dispersed nZVI particles under an applied DC electric field. Due to the applied electric field with an intensity of about 1 V cm(-1), the solution oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) remained as low as -200 mV for at least 32 days, which was in agreement with the persistence of the reduced iron species (mainly Fe(II)), and led to substantially prolonged reactivity of the original nZVI. The treatment of chlorinated ethenes (DCE > PCE > TCE) was markedly faster, individual CHC compounds were eliminated with the same kinetics and no lesser-chlorinated intermediates were accumulated, following thus the direct dechlorination scheme. When nZVI-dispersion flows towards the anode through vertical laboratory columns filled with quartz sand, significant enhancement of nZVI migration was recorded because of lower extent of nanoparticle aggregation and increased repulsion forces between the nanoparticles and the surface of silica dioxide. The results of this study have significant consequences for groundwater remediation, mainly for the treatment of slowly degradable DCE in real CHC contaminated groundwater, where it could improve the reactivity, the longevity and the migration of nZVI particles.",10511.0,"Černík, Miroslav:Nosek, Jaroslav:Filip, Jan:Hrabal, Jaroslav:Elliott, Daniel:Zbořil, Radek",Water Research,1,high,high,0,1,low,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Temporal behavior of deep-seated gravitational slope deformations: A review,"Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) are slow moving, hillslope-scale mass movements featuring characteristic landforms such as double-crested ridges and upslope-facing scarps that occur in diverse landscapes throughout the world. Although these deformations have been studied since the 1960s, significant insights to the rates of DSGSDs have only been gained within the last two decades owing to progress in geochronology, remote sensing and instrumental monitoring. Absolute age and monitoring data indicate that DSGSD movements are observable over long-term (>= 10(2) years) and short-term (<10(2) years) intervals. Apart from creep, an episodic deformation also plays a crucial role, especially in regions with earthquakes and heavy rainfall. Our review also supports the notion of DSGSDs as precursors of catastrophic rock slope failures, given that many of the world's largest rock avalanches have occurred in areas with diagnostic DSGSD features, indicating that sudden collapse was preceded by a prolonged stage of slope sagging. Detailed studies on DSGSDs have therefore the potential for better prediction of catastrophic rock slides and rock avalanches. nFuture research directions include constraining the lifespan of DSGSDs with absolute age dating and precise high resolution monitoring of spatio-temporal displacement across DSGSD bodies. It is of great importance to include absolute time scales in the numerical models of DSGSDs. Furthermore, combining remote sensing techniques such as Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry with high-resolution LiDAR scanning and near-surface geophysics offers a promising toolkit for collecting very detailed and accurate data on the short-term deformation rates of DSGSDs",0.0,"Pánek, T.:Klimeš, Jan",Earth-Science Reviews,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Widespread deoxygenation of temperate lakes.,"The concentration of dissolved oxygen in aquatic systems helps to regulate biodiversity(1,2), nutrient biogeochemistry(3), greenhouse gas emissions(4), and the quality of drinking water(5). The long-term declines in dissolved oxygen concentrations in coastal and ocean waters have been linked to climate warming and human activity(6,7), but little is known about the changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations in lakes. Although the solubility of dissolved oxygen decreases with increasing water temperatures, long-term lake trajectories are difficult to predict. Oxygen losses in warming lakes may be amplified by enhanced decomposition and stronger thermal stratification(8,9) or oxygen may increase as a result of enhanced primary production(10). Here we analyse a combined total of 45,148 dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles and calculate trends for 393 temperate lakes that span 1941 to 2017. We find that a decline in dissolved oxygen is widespread in surface and deep-water habitats. The decline in surface waters is primarily associated with reduced solubility under warmer water temperatures, although dissolved oxygen in surface waters increased in a subset of highly productive warming lakes, probably owing to increasing production of phytoplankton. By contrast, the decline in deep waters is associated with stronger thermal stratification and loss of water clarity, but not with changes in gas solubility. Our results suggest that climate change and declining water clarity have altered the physical and chemical environment of lakes. Declines in dissolved oxygen in freshwater are 2.75 to 9.3 times greater than observed in the world's oceans(6,7) and could threaten essential lake ecosystem services(2,3,5,11).",10501.0,"Jane, S.F.:Hansen, G.J.A.:Kraemer, B.M.:Leavitt, P.

Estimating and localizing the algebraic and total numerical errors using flux reconstructions,"This paper presents a methodology for computing upper and lower bounds for both the algebraic and total errors in the context of the conforming finite element discretization of the Poisson model problem and an arbitrary iterative algebraic solver. The derived bounds do not contain any unspecified constants and allow estimating the local distribution of both errors over the computational domain. Combining these bounds, we also obtain guaranteed upper and lower bounds on the discretization error. This allows to propose novel mathematically justified stopping criteria for iterative algebraic solvers ensuring that the algebraic error will lie below the discretization one. Our upper algebraic and total error bounds are based on locally reconstructed fluxes in H(div,omega), whereas the lower algebraic and total error bounds rely on locally constructed H01(omega)-liftings of the algebraic and total residuals. We prove global and local efficiency of the upper bound on the total error and its robustness with respect to the approximation polynomial degree. Relationships to the previously published estimates on the algebraic error are discussed. Theoretical results are illustrated on numerical experiments for higher-order finite element approximations and the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. They in particular witness that the proposed methodology yields a tight estimate on the local distribution of the algebraic and total errors over the computational domain and illustrate the associated cost.",10102.0,"Papež, Jan:Strakoš, Z.:Vohralík, M.",Numerische Mathematik,1,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Evaluation of scale-up strategies for the batch synthesis of dense and hollow mesoporous silica microspheres,"Despite the wide application interest in mesoporous silica micro- and nano-particles and a number of synthesis routes reported in the literature, the question of chemical engineering scale-up of the synthetic routes has rarely been addressed. The present work reports the results of an experimental and computational study of batch scale-up by a factor of 40x in the specific case of two types of dense and hollow mesoporous silica microparticles produced by the hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) using a CTAB surfactant template. Volume and concentration based scale-up approaches have been investigated and systematically compared using a similarity index that included parameters related to the particle size distribution (d(10), d(50), d(90)) and pore structure (mean pore diameter, specific surface area, total pore volume, sorption hysteresis loop). The particle size distribution was found to be dependent mainly on the hydrodynamic conditions, expressed by the homogenization time, while the pore structure and the overall yield of the process were found to depend mainly on the CTAB/TEOS ratio.

BCR-ABL1 mediated miR-150 downregulation through MYC contributed to myeloid differentiation block and drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia,"The fusion oncoprotein BCR-ABL1 exhibits aberrant tyrosine kinase activity and it has been proposed that it deregulates signaling networks involving both transcription factors and non-coding microRNAs that result in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Previously, microRNA expression profiling showed deregulated expression of miR150 and miR-155 in CML. In this study, we placed these findings into the broader context of the MYC/miR-150/MYB/miR-155/PU. 1 oncogenic network. We propose that up-regulated MYC and miR-155 in CD34(+) leukemic stem and progenitor cells, in concert with BCR-ABL1, impair the molecular mechanisms of myeloid differentiation associated with low miR-150 and PU.1 levels. We revealed that MYC directly occupied the -11.7 kb and -0.35 kb regulatory regions in the MIR150 gene. MYC occupancy was markedly increased through BCR-ABL1 activity, causing inhibition of MIR150 gene expression in CML CD34(+) and CD34-cells. Furthermore, we found an association between reduced miR-150 levels in CML blast cells and their resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although TKIs successfully disrupted BCR-ABL1 kinase activity in proliferating CML cells, this treatment did not efficiently target quiescent leukemic stem cells. The study presents new evidence regarding the MYC/miR-150/MYB/miR-155/PU. 1 leukemic network established by aberrant BCR-ABL1 activity.

The model provides the same fit to choice data as dynamic logit, but, because of the bias, yields different counterfactual predictions.

These Hif1aCKO mice demonstrate significantly decreased perinatal survival and impaired left ventricular function. The absence of HIF-1 alpha impaired the survival and proliferation of preganglionic and postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic system, respectively. These defects resulted in hypoplasia of the sympathetic ganglion chain and decreased sympathetic innervation of the Hif1aCKO heart, which was associated with decreased cardiac contractility.

Susceptibility of European freshwater fish to climate change: Species profiling based on life-history and environmental characteristics,"Climate change is expected to strongly affect freshwater fish communities. Combined with other anthropogenic drivers, the impacts may alter species spatio-temporal distributions and contribute to population declines and local extinctions. To provide timely management and conservation of fishes, it is relevant to identify species that will be most impacted by climate change and those that will be resilient. Species traits are considered a promising source of information on characteristics that influence resilience to various environmental conditions and impacts. To this end, we collated life-history traits and climatic niches of 443 European freshwater fish species and compared those identified as susceptible to climate change to those that are considered to be resilient. Significant differences were observed between the two groups in their distribution, life history, and climatic niche, with climate-change-susceptible species being distributed within the Mediterranean region, and being characterized by greater threat levels, lesser commercial relevance, lower vulnerability to fishing, smaller body and range size, and warmer thermal envelopes. Based on our results, we establish a list of species of highest priority for further research and monitoring regarding climate-change susceptibility within Europe.

Monitoring of childhood ALL using BCR-ABL1 genomic breakpoints identifies a subgroup with CML-like biology,"We used the genomic breakpoint between BCR and ABL1 genes for the DNA-based monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in 48 patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Comparing the results with standard MRD monitoring based on immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor (Ig/TCR) gene rearrangements and with quantification of IKZF1 deletion, we observed very good correlation for the methods in a majority of patients, however, &gt,20% of children (25% [8/32] with minor and 12.5% [1/8] with major-BCR-ABL1 variants in the consecutive cohorts) had significantly (&gt,1 log) higher levels of BCR-ABL1 fusion than Ig/TCR rearrangements and/or IKZF1 deletion.

A unified dinucleotide alphabet describing both RNA and DNA structures,"By analyzing almost 120 000 dinucleotides in over 2000 nonredundant nucleic acid crystal structures, we define 96+1 diNucleotide Conformers, NtCs, which describe the geometry of RNA and DNA dinucleotides. NtC classes are grouped into 15 codes of the structural alphabet CANA (Conformational Alphabet of Nucleic Acids) to simplify symbolic annotation of the prominent structural features of NAs and their intuitive graphical display. The search for nontrivial patterns of NtCs resulted in the identification of several types of RNA loops, some of them observed for the first time. Over 30% of the nearly six million dinucleotides in the PDB cannot be assigned to any NtC class but we demonstrate that up to a half of them can be re-refined with the help of proper refinement targets. A statistical analysis of the preferences of NtCs and CANA codes for the 16 dinucleotide sequences showed that neither the NtC class AA00, which forms the scaffold of RNA structures, nor BB00, the DNA most populated class, are sequence neutral but their distributions are significantly biased.

Impact of Halogenido Coligands on Magnetic Anisotropy in Seven-Coordinate Co(II) Complexes,"The structural and magnetic features of a series of mononuclear seven-coordinate Co-II complexes with the general formula [Co(L)X-2], where L is a 15-membered pyridine-based macrocyclic ligand (3,12,18-triaza-6,9-dioxabicyclo[12.3.1]octadeca-1(18),14,16-triene) and X = Cl- (1), Br- (2), or I- (3), were investigated experimentally and theoretically in order to reveal how the corresponding halogenido coligands in the apical positions of a distorted pentagonalbipyramidal coordination polyhedron may affect the magnetic properties of the prepared compounds. The thorough analyses of the magnetic data revealed a large easy-plane type of the magnetic anisotropy (D &gt, 0) for all three compounds, with the D-values increasing in the order 35 cm(-1) for 3 (I-), 38 cm(-1) for 1 (Cl-), and 41 cm(-1) for 2 (Br-). Various theoretical methods like the Angular Overlap Model, density functional theory, CASSCF/CASPT2, CASSCF/NEVPT2 were utilized in order to understand the observed trend in magnetic anisotropy. The D-values correlated well with the Mayer bond order (decreasing in order Co-I &gt, Co-Cl &gt, Co-Br), which could be a consequence of two competing factors: (a) the ligand field splitting and (b) the covalence of the CoX bond. All the complexes also behave as field-induced single-molecule magnets with the spin reversal barrier U-eff increasing in order 1 (Cl-) &lt, 2 (Br-) &lt, 3 (I-), however, taking into account the easy-plane type of the magnetic anisotropy, the Raman relaxation process is most likely responsible for slow relaxation of the magnetization. The results of the work revealed that the previously suggested and fully accepted strategy employing heavier halogenido ligands in order to increase the magnetic anisotropy has some limitations in the case of pentagonalbipyramidal Co-II complexes.",10402.0,"Drahoš, Bohuslav:Herchel, Radovan:Trávníček, Zdeněk",Inorganic Chemistry,1,low,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

We exploit a policy reform in which public bodies were given the autonomy to preselect potential contractors below newly defined discretionary thresholds. Manipulation is revealed through bunching of procurements just below the thresholds in construction works and services, and to a lesser degree, in goods.

Salinity gradient power reverse electrodialysis: Cation exchange membrane design based on polypyrrole-chitosan composites for enhanced monovalent selectivity,"Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is one of the most promising membrane-based processes for renewable energy generation from mixing two solutions of different salinity. However, the presence of Mg2+ in natural water has been shown to drastically reduce open circuit voltage (OCV) and output power of RED. To alleviate this challenge, commercial cation exchange membranes (CEM) supplied by Fujifilm Manufacturing Europe B.V. (The Netherlands) were chemically modified by polypyrrole (PPy)/chitosan (CS) composites under controlled Pyrrole (Py) concentration (0.025–1 M) and polymerization time (0–8 h). The modified membranes were physically characterized by FTIR, SEM and EDX along with the determination of key electrochemical properties like ion exchange capacity, ionic conductivity, monovalent selectivity and swelling degree. The monovalent selectivity (Na+ vs Mg2+) of the modified membranes, evaluated based on flux of ions by diffusion dialysis, indicated up to 3-fold improvement compared to pristine membranes inline with the enhanced OCV (up to 20%) during RED test in multi-ion solution. This was obtained without significant change in membrane and interface resistances as depicted by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The modified membranes displayed power densities in the range of 0.6–1.5 W/m2MP (MP: membrane pair) with more than 42% improvement compared to pristine membranes during RED test with multi-ion solutions. Although there is a gap for further improvement, these findings highlight a promising use of conducting polymers to design a highly selective and conductive membrane for RED. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10405.0,"Tufa, Ramato Ashu:Piallat, Théo:Hnát, Jaromír:Fontananova, E.:Paidar, Martin:Chanda, D.:Curcio, E.:di Profio, G.:Bouzek, Karel",Chemical Engineering Journal,1,medium,high,0,1,high,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Enhancing the Cross-Cultural Comparability of Self-Reports Using the Overclaiming Technique: An Analysis of Accuracy and Exaggeration in 64 Cultures,"The overclaiming technique (OCT) is a novel way of measuring how socially desirable responding influences survey responses. It has the potential to enhance the cross-cultural comparability of survey data. It allows the identification of respondents&apos, knowledge accuracy and exaggeration by comparing their assessments of familiarity with existing and nonexisting concepts in a particular field of knowledge. We aim to compare the response patterns of countries and world regions based on their OCT accuracy and exaggeration-index values and validate these OCT scores using external variables. We also introduce a general model for the categorization of respondents based on their OCT indices values. We use the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 data from 64 countries (N = 275,904). We found considerable differences in response patterns across world regions: high accuracy values in East Asia, low accuracy values in Southern and Central America, high exaggeration values in Southern Europe, and low exaggeration values in Western Europe. Furthermore, we show that familiarity with math concepts changes substantially after adjustment using the OCT. The correlation between unadjusted math familiarity and math test scores is weak and nonsignificant (.13) whereas after adjustment the correlation becomes strong and significant (.66). Concerning other indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), public expenditure in education, and Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), before adjustment the correlation is negative and even significant for CPI (-.11, -.22, and -.45) whereas after adjustment the correlation becomes, though nonsignificant, positive (.05, .19, and .07).

Best Practices for the Prevention of Radial Artery Occlusion After Transradial Diagnostic Angiography and Intervention An International Consensus Paper,"Transradial access (TRA) is increasingly used worldwide for percutaneous interventional procedures and associated with lower bleeding and vascular complications than transfemoral artery access. Radial artery occlusion (RAO) is the most frequent post-procedural complication of TRA, restricting the use of the same radial artery for future procedures and as a conduit for coronary artery bypass graft. The authors review recent advances in the prevention of RAO following percutaneous TRA diagnostic or interventional procedures. Based on the available data, the authors provide easily applicable and effective recommendations to prevent periprocedural RAO and maximize the chances of access in case of repeat catheterization or coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

Environment and host as large-scale controls of ectomycorrhizal fungi,"Explaining the large-scale diversity of soil organisms that drive biogeochemical processes - and their responses to environmental change - is critical. However, identifying consistent drivers of belowground diversity and abundance for some soil organisms at large spatial scales remains problematic. Here we investigate a major guild, the ectomycorrhizal fungi, across European forests at a spatial scale and resolution that is - to our knowledge - unprecedented, to explore key biotic and abiotic predictors of ectomycorrhizal diversity and to identify dominant responses and thresholds for change across complex environmental gradients. We show the effect of 38 host, environment, climate and geographical variables on ectomycorrhizal diversity, and define thresholds of community change for key variables. We quantify host specificity and reveal plasticity in functional traits involved in soil foraging across gradients. We conclude that environmental and host factors explain most of the variation in ectomycorrhizal diversity, that the environmental thresholds used as major ecosystem assessment tools need adjustment and that the importance of belowground specificity and plasticity has previously been underappreciated.",10618.0,"Šrámek, Vít",Nature,1,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Proton–Electron Transfer to the Active Site Is Essential for the Reaction Mechanism of Soluble Δ9-Desaturase,"A full understanding of the catalytic action of non-heme iron (NHFe) and non-heme diiron (NHFe2) enzymes is still beyond the grasp of contemporary computational and experimental techniques. Many of these enzymes exhibit fascinating chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity, in spite of employing highly reactive intermediates which are necessary for activations of most stable chemical bonds. Herein, we study in detail one intriguing representative of the NHFe2 family of enzymes: soluble Δ9 desaturase (Δ9D), which desaturates rather than performing the thermodynamically favorable hydroxylation of substrate. Its catalytic mechanism has been explored in great detail by using QM(DFT)/MM and multireference wave function methods. Starting from the spectroscopically observed 1,2-μ-peroxo diferric P intermediate, the proton–electron uptake by P is the favored mechanism for catalytic activation, since it allows a significant reduction of the barrier of the initial (and rate-determining) H-atom abstraction from the stearoyl substrate as compared to the “proton-only activated” pathway. Also, we ruled out that a Q-like intermediate (high-valent diamond-core bis-μ-oxo-[FeIV]2 unit) is involved in the reaction mechanism. Our mechanistic picture is consistent with the experimental data available for Δ9D and satisfies fairly stringent conditions required by Nature: the chemo-, stereo-, and regioselectivity of the desaturation of stearic acid. Finally, the mechanisms evaluated are placed into a broader context of NHFe2 chemistry, provided by an amino acid sequence analysis through the families of the NHFe2 enzymes. Our study thus represents an important contribution toward understanding the catalytic action of the NHFe2 enzymes and may inspire further work in NHFe(2) biomimetic chemistry.",10403.0,"Bím, Daniel:Chalupský, Jakub:Culka, Martin:Solomon, E.

Magnetic mapping of distribution of wood ash used for fertilization of forest soil,"The effect of wood-ash fertilization on forest soils has been assessed mainly through geochemical methods (e.g., content of soil organic matter or nutrients). However, a simple and fastmethod of determining the distribution of the ash and the extent of affected soil is missing. In this studywe present the use of magnetic susceptibility, which is controlled by Fe-oxides, in comparing the fertilized soil in the forest plantation of pine and oakwith intact forest soil. Spatial and vertical distribution of magnetic susceptibility was measured in an oak and pine plantation next to stems of young plants, where wood ash was applied as fertilizer. Pattern of the susceptibility distribution was compared with that in non-fertilized part of the plantation as well as with a spot of intact natural forest soil nearby. Our results showthat the wood-ash samples contain significant amount of ferrimagnetic magnetite with susceptibility higher than that of typical forest soil. Clear differences were observed between magnetic susceptibility of furrows and ridges. Moreover, the dispersed ash remains practically on the surface, does not penetrate to deeper layers. Finally, our data suggest significant differences in surface values between the pine and oak plants. Based on this study we may conclude that magnetic susceptibility may represent a simple and approximate method of assessing the extent of soil affected by wood-ash.",10508.0,"Petrovský, Eduard:Remeš, J.:Kapička, Aleš:Podrázský, V.:Grison, Hana:Borůvka, L.",Science of the Total Environment,2,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
High efficiency of Pt2+ - CeO2 novel thin film catalyst as anode for proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"The elevated price of Pt limits the large-scale implementation of commercial proton exchange membrane fuel cells, which effectively convert chemical energy into electricity. In order to increase the cost-efficiency in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, we have designed a family of novel anode catalysts consisting of thin films of ceria with low Pt loadings sputtered on a nanostructured carbon support. Remarkably, only such small amounts of Pt are necessary for achieving power density values comparable to the reference commercial catalysts, which results in excellent specific activities of our samples. By combining photoelectron spectroscopy and catalytic performance analysis, we have shown that the surface Pt2+ species in cerium oxide exhibit high electrocatalytic activity.

Impact of blood pressure levels within first 24 hours after mechanical thrombectomy on clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients,"Introduction: Despite early management and technical success of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), not all patients reach a good clinical outcome. Different factors may have an impact and we aimed to evaluate blood pressure (BP) levels in the first 24hours after MT. Methods: Consecutive AIS patients treated with MT were enrolled in the retrospective bi-center study. Neurological deficit was assessed with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and functional outcome after 3 months with modified Rankin scale (mRS) with a score 0-2 for good outcome. The presence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) was assessed according to the SITS-MOST criteria. Results: Of 703 treated patients, completed BP levels were collected in 690 patients (350 males, mean age 7113 years) with median of admission NIHSS 17 points. Patients with mRS 0-2 had a lower median of systolic BP (SBP) compared with those with poor outcome (131 vs 140 mm Hg, P<0.0001). The rate of SICH did not differ between the patients with a median of SBP <140 mm Hg and >= 140 mm Hg. (5.1% vs 5.1%, P=0.980). Multivariate regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders showed a median of distolic BP (P=0.024, OR: 0.977, 95%CI: 0.957 to 0.997) as a predictor of good functional outcome after MT, and a median of maximal SBP (P=0.038, OR: 0.990, 95%CI: 0.981 to 0.999) in the patients with achieved recanalization.

The restoration of the Stone Fountain in Kutná Hora: An assessment of the contemporary intervention within the context of repairs throughout history,"The Stone Fountain is situated in the historical centre of Kutná Hora, a UNESCO listed town, and one of the most important monuments in Bohemia. The fountain was constructed from 1493 to 1495 and was originally built of biodetritic limestone. During extensive reconstruction in the nineteenth century a substantial part of the ornamentation was replaced with fine-grained sandstone of inferior quality, resulting in a range of problems at a later date. During the twentieth century, the fountain underwent several repairs which failed to halt the process of degradation, and conversely had a negative effect on the condition of the monument. The last restoration intervention, undertaken from 2010 to 2011, resulted after a thorough examination of the monument documenting the damage and establishing the principal causes of the damage. The subsequent conservation, proposed on the basis of the aforementioned examination, revolved around the extensive cement repairs and acrylic coatings covering the surface, causing significant deterioration to the stone underneath. Furthermore, the deep salinity of the masonry and vast diversity of materials had to be addressed, alongside questions concerning the presentation of the architectonic work and options for its preventive conservation.

Cationic Versus Anionic Phthalocyanines for Photodynamic Therapy: What a Difference the Charge Makes,"The literature reports on cationic and anionic phthalocyanines (Pcs) for photodynamic therapy suggest systematically significant differences in activity. In this work, ten different zinc(II) Pcs with carboxylate functions or quaternary nitrogens (hydrophilic anionic, hydrophilic cationic, amphiphilic anionic, and amphiphilic cationic) were investigated, with the aim of revealing reasons for such differences. In vitro assays on HeLa, MCF-7, and HCT-116 cells confirmed higher photoactivity for cationic Pcs (EC50 similar to 3-50 nM) than for anionic Pcs (EC50 similar to 0.3-10 mu M), the latter being additionally significantly more active in serum-free medium. The environmental pH, binding to serum proteins, interaction with biomembranes, differences in subcellular localization, and relocalization after irradiation were found to be the main factors contributing to the generally lower photoactivity of anionic Pcs than that of the cationic derivatives.

Discovery of 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) Prodrugs with Enhanced CSF Delivery in Monkeys: A Potential Treatment for Glioblastoma,"The glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON, 1) has shown robust anticancer efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies, but its development was halted due to marked systemic toxicities. Herein we demonstrate that DON inhibits glutamine metabolism and provides antitumor efficacy in a murine model of glioblastoma, although toxicity was observed. To enhance DONs therapeutic index, we utilized a prodrug strategy to increase its brain delivery and limit systemic exposure. Unexpectedly, simple alkyl ester-based prodrugs were ineffective due to chemical instability cyclizing to form a unique diazo-imine. However, masking both DONs amine and carboxylate functionalities imparted sufficient chemical stability for biological testing. While these dual moiety prodrugs exhibited rapid metabolism in mouse plasma, several provided excellent stability in monkey and human plasma.

Progress in waste utilization via thermal plasma,"As the world races toward its urban future, the quantity of wastes, one of the vital by-products of an enhancement in the standards of living, is exponentially rising. The treatment of wastes employing plasma is an upcoming area of research and is globally used for the simultaneous processing of diverse wastes coupled with the recovery of energy and materials. Ground-breaking and cost-effective thermal plasma technologies with high efficiencies are a prerequisite for the growth of this technology. This paper delivers an evaluation of the fundamentals such as the generation and characteristics of the thermal plasma along with the various types of wastes treatable by thermal plasma and the related issues. Furthermore, the authors discuss different types of advanced technologies as well as the material and energy recovery techniques and their present status worldwide, at lab-scale and industrial scale. The application of different thermal plasma technologies is discussed as a means to promote this technology into alternative applications, which require higher flexibility and greater efficiency. Mathematical modeling studies are also assessed with an objective to derive ideal conditions and permissible limits for the reactors and to test a variety of waste materials. A strategy to improve the feasibility and sustainability of waste utilization is via technological advancement and the minimization of environmental effects and process economics. This paper sheds light on diverse areas of waste utilization via thermal plasma as a potentially sustainable and environmentally friendly technology. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Msx1 loss suppresses formation of the ectopic crypts developed in the Apc-deficient small intestinal epithelium,"The first step in the development of human colorectal cancer is aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt signaling hyperactivation is predominantly caused by loss-of-function mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene that encodes the pathway negative regulator. In order to identify genes affected by the Apc loss, we performed expression profiling of intestinal epithelium isolated from mice harboring a conditional Apc allele. The gene encoding transcriptional factor msh homeobox 1 (Msx1) displayed robust upregulation upon Apc inactivation. Histological analysis of the Apc-deficient epithelium revealed that in the small intestine, the Msx1 protein was localized exclusively in ectopic crypts, i.e., in pockets of proliferating cells abnormally positioned on the villi. Ablation of the Msx1 gene leads to the disappearance of ectopic crypts and loss of differentiated cells. Moreover, tumors arising from Msx1-deficient cells display altered morphology reminiscent of villous adenomas. In human tumor specimens, MSX1 displayed significantly increased expression in colonic neoplasia with a descending tendency during the lesion progression towards colorectal carcinoma. In summary, the results indicate that Msx1 represents a novel marker of intestinal tumorigenesis. In addition, we described the previously unknown relationship between the Msx1-dependent formation of ectopic crypts and cell differentiation.",10601.0,"Horázná, Monika:Janečková, Lucie:Švec, Jiří:Babošová, Oľga:Hrčkulák, Dušan:Vojtěchová, Martina:Galušková, Kateřina:Šloncová, Eva:Kolář, Michal:Strnad, Hynek:Kořínek, Vladimír",Scientific Reports,2,high,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The internal structure of magnetic nanoparticles determines the magnetic response,"This work aims to emphasize that the magnetic response of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) is driven by the NPs&apos, internal structure, and the NP size dependencies of magnetic properties are overestimated. The relationship between the degree of the NPs&apos, crystallinity and magnetic response is unambiguously demonstrated in eight samples of uniform maghemite/ magnetite NPs and corroborated with the results obtained for about 20 samples of spinel ferrite NPs with different degrees of crystallinity. The NP samples were prepared by the thermal decomposition of an organic iron precursor subjected to varying reaction conditions, yielding variations in the NP size, shape and relative crystallinity. We characterized the samples by using several complementary methods, such as powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) and Mssbauer spectroscopy (MS). We evaluated the NPs&apos, relative crystallinity by comparing the NP sizes determined from TEM and PXRD and further inspecting the NPs&apos, internal structure and relative crystallinity by using HR-TEM. The results of the structural characterization were put in the context of the NPs&apos, magnetic response. In this work, the highest saturation magnetization (Ms) was measured for the smallest but well-crystalline NPs, while the larger NPs exhibiting worse crystallinity revealed a lower Ms. Our results clearly demonstrate that the NP crystallinity level that is mirrored in the internal spin order drives the specific magnetic response of the single-domain NPs.",10302.0,"Pacáková, Barbara:Kubíčková, Simona:Salas, Gorka:Řezníčková, Alice:Marciello, Marzia:Morales, María Puerto:Nižňanský, Daniel:Kalbáčová Vejpravová, Jana",Nanoscale [online],2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dioxygenase for auxin oxidation 1 catalyzes the oxidation of IAA amino acid conjugates,"Together with auxin transport, auxin metabolism is a key determinant of auxin signaling output by plant cells. Enzymatic machinery involved in auxin metabolism is subject to regulation based on numerous inputs, including the concentration of auxin itself. Therefore, experiments characterizing altered auxin availability and subsequent changes in auxin metabolism could elucidate the function and regulatory role of individual elements in the auxin metabolic machinery. Here, we studied auxin metabolism in auxin-dependent tobacco BY-2 cells. We revealed that the concentration of N-(2-oxindole-3-acetyl)-L-aspartic acid (oxIAA-Asp), the most abundant auxin metabolite produced in the control culture, dramatically decreased in auxin-starved BY-2 cells. Analysis of the transcriptome and proteome in auxin-starved cells uncovered significant downregulation of all tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) homologs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DIOXYGENASE FOR AUXIN OXIDATION 1 (DAO1), at both transcript and protein levels. Auxin metabolism profiling in BY-2 mutants carrying either siRNA-silenced or CRISPR-Cas9-mutated NtDAO1, as well as in dao1-1 Arabidopsis plants, showed not only the expected lower levels of oxIAA, but also significantly lower abundance of oxIAA-Asp. Finally, ability of DAO1 to oxidize IAA-Asp was confirmed by an enzyme assay in AtDAO1-producing bacterial culture.

Vestiges of the Bacterial Signal Recognition Particle-Based Protein Targeting in Mitochondria,"The main bacterial pathway for inserting proteins into the plasma membrane relies on the signal recognition particle (SRP), composed of the Ffh protein and an associated RNA component, and the SRP-docking protein FtsY. Eukaryotes use an equivalent system of archaeal origin to deliver proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas a bacteria-derived SRP and FtsY function in the plastid. Here we report on the presence of homologs of the bacterial Ffh and FtsY proteins in various unrelated plastid-lacking unicellular eukaryotes, namely Heterolobosea, Alveida, Goniomonas, and Hemimastigophora. The monophyly of novel eukaryotic Ffh and FtsY groups, predicted mitochondrial localization experimentally confirmed for Naegleria gruberi, and a strong alphaproteobacterial affinity of the Ffh group, collectively suggest that they constitute parts of an ancestral mitochondrial signal peptide-based protein-targeting system inherited from the last eukaryotic common ancestor, but lost from the majority of extant eukaryotes. The ability of putative signal peptides, predicted in a subset of mitochondrial-encoded N. gruberi proteins, to target a reporter fluorescent protein into the endoplasmic reticulum of Trypanosoma brucei, likely through their interaction with the cytosolic SRP, provided further support for this notion. We also illustrate that known mitochondrial ribosome-interacting proteins implicated in membrane protein targeting in opisthokonts (Mbal, Mdm38, and Mrx15) are broadly conserved in eukaryotes and nonredundant with the mitochondrial SRP system. Finally, we identified a novel mitochondrial protein (MAP67) present in diverse eukaryotes and related to the signal peptide-binding domain of Ffh, which may well be a hitherto unrecognized component of the mitochondrial membrane protein-targeting machinery.",10606.0,"Pyrih, Jan:Pánek, T.:Durante, Ignacio Miguel:Rašková, Vendula:Cimrhanzlová, Kristýna:Kriegová, Eva:Tsaousis, A.:Eliáš, M.:Lukeš, Julius",Molecular Biology and Evolution,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Structure, mechanical characteristics and in vitro degradation, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity of novel biodegradable Zn-Mg alloys","Zn-(0-1.6)Mg (in wt.%) alloys were prepared by hot extrusion at 300 degrees C. The structure, mechanical properties and in vitro biocompatibility of the alloys were investigated. The hot-extruded magnesium-based WE43 alloy was used as a control. Mechanical properties were evaluated by hardness, compressive and tensile testing. The cytotoxicity, genotoxicity (comet assay) and mutagenicity (Ames test) of the alloy extracts and ZnCl2 solutions were evaluated with the use of murine fibroblasts L929 and human osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS. The microstructure of the Zn alloys consisted of recrystallized Zn grains of 12 11111 in size and fine Mg2Zn1.1 particles arranged parallel to the hot extrusion direction. Mechanical tests revealed that the hardness and strength increased with increasing Mg concentration. The Zn-0.8 Mg alloys showed the best combination of tensile mechanical properties (tensile yield strength of 203 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 301 MPa and elongation of 15%). At higher Mg concentrations the plasticity of Zn-Mg alloys was deteriorated. Cytotoxicity tests with alloy extracts and ZnCl2 solutions proved the maximum safe Zn2+ concentrations of 120 mu M and 80 mu M for the 0-2 OS and L929 cell lines, respectively.

Airborne concentrations and chemical considerations of radioactive ruthenium from an undeclared major nuclear release in 2017,"In October 2017, most European countries reported unique atmospheric detections of aerosol-bound radioruthenium (106Ru). The range of concentrations varied from some tenths of µBq·m-3 to more than 150 mBq·m-3 The widespread detection at such considerable (yet innocuous) levels suggested a considerable release. To compare activity reports of airborne 106Ru with different sampling periods, concentrations were reconstructed based on the most probable plume presence duration at each location. Based on airborne concentration spreading and chemical considerations, it is possible to assume that the release occurred in the Southern Urals region (Russian Federation). The 106Ru age was estimated to be about 2 years. It exhibited highly soluble and less soluble fractions in aqueous media, high radiopurity (lack of concomitant radionuclides), and volatility between 700 and 1,000 °C, thus suggesting a release at an advanced stage in the reprocessing of nuclear fuel.

Re-reuse of regenerated brownfields: Lessons from an Eastern European post-industrial city,"Brownfields constitute a substantial portion of the land area in post-industrial cities. Many brownfields have been regenerated for various uses, addressing a range of extant problems in urban areas. However, re-use plans for current brownfields are driven by market demand and public sector prioritization and do not always meet the requirements of local residents and visitors. In this paper, we investigate how a range of brownfields re-use options are perceived by residents and visitors to the Landek area in the city of Ostrava (Czech Republic). By analysing the results of the questionnaire survey (n = 180) we found that future brownfields uses such as culture/sport and children&apos,s park are the most popular options. We found that gender was a statistically significant predictor of preferred reuse options. Women are strong supporters of the above-mentioned re-use options, while men tend to favour re-use options which promote industry. Remarkably, respondents, in general, lacked concrete ideas concerning alternative re-use options of brownfields, suggesting that professional urban planners can be of assistance in the planning of the future use of brownfield sites.",50702.0,"Martinat, Stanislav:Navrátil, Josef:Hollander, Justin B.:Trojan, Jakub:Klapka, Pavel:Klusáček, Petr:Kalok, David",Journal of Cleaner Production,2,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Frequent fires control tree spatial pattern, mortality and regeneration in Argentine open woodlands","In open woodlands and savannas, fire is often the dominant disturbance that shapes and maintains their structure and dynamics. Numerous studies have explored tree-grass coexistence under different fire regimes in these ecosystems, however, there is a lack of research on the tree-tree relationship in the presence or absence of fire. In the present study, we explored the effects of fire regime on tree spatial pattern, mortality and regeneration in the Argentine Caldenal, which is one of the most endangered and least studied open woodlands in the Neotropics. While there was no significant difference in the overall tree density between frequently burned and fire-excluded regimes, we found clear divergences between fire regimes in the within-stand spacing of not only all trees, but also of large and small trees in addition to their spatial interactions. In contrast with previous results from other frequently burned open forests, trees in the Caldenal were randomly distributed in burned plots whereas both mid-and long-term fire exclusion lead to the strong short-scale aggregation of trees. In the absence of fire, both large and small trees were significantly clumped, but in the frequently burned woodlands, large and small trees had a tendency to repulsion and aggregation, respectively. Fire regime also significantly affected tree mortality and regeneration mechanisms in the Caldenal. Our mortality analysis indicated that fire suppression led to the shift from fire-induced to competition-driven mortality of trees. When analysing tree regeneration, we found a lack of seedlings in any of the fire regimes but the presence of vigorous sprouting only in frequently burned plots. The present study thus revealed the key role of frequent fires in the Caldenal open woodlands because recurrent burning not only shaped the spatial arrangement of trees, but fire-induced mortality also triggered an essential tree recruitment mechanism in these ecosystems.",40102.0,"Svátek, Martin:Rejžek, Martin:Kvasnica, Jakub:Řepka, Radomír:Matula, Radim",Forest Ecology and Management,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"IFNγ induces oxidative stress, DNA damage and tumor cell senescence via TGFβ/SMAD signaling-dependent induction of Nox4 and suppression of ANT2","Cellular senescence provides a biological barrier against tumor progression, often associated with oncogene-induced replication and/or oxidative stress, cytokine production and DNA damage response (DDR), leading to persistent cell-cycle arrest. While cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) are important components of senescence-associated secretome and induce senescence in, for example, mouse pancreatic β-cancer cell model, their downstream signaling pathway(s) and links with oxidative stress and DDR are mechanistically unclear. Using human and mouse normal and cancer cell models, we now show that TNFα and IFNγ induce NADPH oxidases Nox4 and Nox1, reactive oxygen species (ROS), DDR signaling and premature senescence. Unlike mouse tumor cells that required concomitant presence of IFNγ and TNFα, short exposure to IFNγ alone was sufficient to induce Nox4, Nox1 and DDR in human cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Nox4 but not Nox1 decreased IFNγ-induced DDR. The expression of Nox4/Nox1 required Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling and the effect was mediated by downstream activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) secretion and consequent autocrine/paracrine activation of the TGFβ/Smad pathway. Furthermore, the expression of adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2) was suppressed by IFNγ contributing to elevation of ROS and DNA damage. In contrast to mouse B16 cells, inability of TC-1 cells to respond to IFNγ/TNFα by DDR and senescence correlated with the lack of TGFβ and Nox4 response, supporting the role of ROS induced by NADPH oxidases in cytokine-induced senescence. Overall, our data reveal differences between cytokine effects in mouse and human cells, and mechanistically implicate the TGFβ/SMAD pathway, via induction of NADPH oxidases and suppression of ANT2, as key mediators of IFNγ/TNFα-evoked genotoxicity and cellular senescence.",10603.0,"Hubáčková, Soňa:Kučerová, Alena:Michlits, Georg:Kyjacová, Lenka:Reiniš, Milan:Korolov, Oleksandr:Bartek, Jiří:Hodný, Zdeněk",Oncogene,2,high,high,1,1,high,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Surprisingly, the practical use of RDS in surveying homeless populations has only sporadically been described in the professional literature so far, and the specifics of using RDS for sampling this group have not been reflected in depth.

Effects of prebiotic dietary fibers and probiotics on human health: With special focus on recent advancement in their encapsulated formulations,"Background: Dietary fibers (DFs) are known as potential formulations in human health due to their beneficial effects in control of life-threatening chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, obesity and cancer. In recent decades scientists around the globe have shown tremendous interest to evaluate the interplay between DFs and gastrointestinal (GIT) microbiota. Evidences from various epidemiological and clinical trials have revealed that DFs modulate formation and metabolic activities of the microbial communities residing in the human GIT which in turn play significant roles in maintaining health and well-being. Furthermore, interestingly, a rapidly growing literature indicates success of DFs being prebiotics in immunomodulation, namely the stimulation of innate, cellular and humoral immune response, which could also be linked with their significant roles in modulation of the probiotics (live beneficial microorganisms). Scope and approach: The main focus of the current review is to expressively highlight the importance of DFs being prebiotics in human health in association with their influence on gut microbiota. Now in order to significantly achieve the promising health benefits from these prebiotics, it is aimed to develop novel formulations to enhance and scale up their efficacy. Therefore, finally, herein unlike previously published articles, we highlighted different kinds of prebiotic and probiotic formulations which are being regarded as hot research topics among the scientific community now a days.

IDH1 mutation is associated with lower expression of VEGF but not microvessel formation in glioblastoma multiforme,"Introduction: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the most malignant primary brain tumor characterized by pathological vascularization. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) were observed in GBM. We aimed to assess the intra-tumor hypoxia, angiogenesis and microvessel formation in GBM and to find their associations with IDH1 mutation status and patients prognosis. Methods: 52 patients with a diagnosis of GBM were included into the study. IDH1 R132H mutation was assessed by RT-PCR from FFPE tumor samples obtained during surgery. The expression of markers of hypoxia (HIF2α), angiogenesis (VEGF), tumor microvascularity (CD31, CD34, vWF, CD105), and proliferation (Ki-67) were assessed immunohistochemically (IHC). IDH1 mutation and IHC markers were correlated with the patient survival. Results: 20 from 52 GBM tumor samples comprised IDH1 R132H mutation (38.5%). The majority of mutated tumors were classified as secondary glioblastomas (89.9%). Patients with IDH1 mutated tumors experienced better progression-free survival (P = 0.037) as well as overall survival (P = 0.035) compared with wild type tumors. The significantly lower expression of VEGF was observed in GBM with IDH1 mutation than in wild type tumors (P = 0.01). No such association was found for microvascular markers. The increased expression of newly-formed microvessels (ratio CD105/CD31) in tumor samples was associated with worse patient&apos,s progression-free survival (P = 0.026). Summary: No increase in HIF/VEGF-mediated angiogenesis was observed in IDH1-mutated GBM compared with IDH1 wild type tumors.

Most authors, who are concerned with the effects the design of constitution-making processes have on outcomes, have focused on the main constitution-making bodies and their characteristics, leaving aside the question of what happens before members of constituent assemblies meet to deliberate. This article makes the point that to better understand constitution-making and its outcomes, we need to take into account the overlooked early stage of constitutional change when political actors debate and set the rules for how a constitution will be made. Building on various political science perspectives and the case study of the 2011-2012 constitutional reform in Egypt, it underscores the inevitably contentious nature of the design of a constitution-making process. It also highlights the impact that unresolved conflicts over the design can have for the agreement on a constitution between political opponents in the context of a democratic transition. In Egypt, adoption of a broadly accepted constitution was hindered by on-going struggles between Islamists and non-Islamists over their preferred constitution-making designs. The article also outlines the factors that make the settlement on constitution-making rules unlikely.",50601.0,"Jermanová, Tereza",Acta Politica,2,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Opinion Diffusion and Campaigning on Society Graphs,"We study the effects of campaigning, where the society is partitioned into voter clusters and a diffusion process propagates opinions in a network connecting those clusters.

Accounting for long-term directional trends on year-to-year synchrony in species fluctuations,"What determines the stability of communities under environmental fluctuations remains one of the most debated questions in ecology. Scholars generally agree that the similarity in year-to-year fluctuations between species is an important determinant of this stability. Concordant fluctuations in species abundances through time (synchrony) decrease stability while discordance in fluctuations (anti-synchrony) should stabilize communities. Researchers have interpreted the community-wide degree of synchrony in temporal fluctuations as the outcome of different processes. However, existing synchrony measures depend not only on year-to-year species fluctuations, but also on long-term directional trends in species composition, for example due to land-use or climate change. The neglected effect of directional trends in species composition could cause an apparent increase in synchrony that is not due to year-to-year fluctuations, as species that simultaneously increase (or decrease) in abundance over time will appear correlated, even if they fluctuate discordantly from year to year. The opposite pattern is also conceivable, where different species show contrasting trends in their abundances, thus overestimating year-to-year anti-synchrony. Therefore, trends in species composition may limit our understanding of potential ecological mechanisms behind synchrony between species. We propose two easily implementable solutions, with corresponding R functions, for testing and accounting for the effect of trends in species composition on overall synchrony. The first approach is based on computing synchrony over the residuals of fitted species trends over time. The second approach, applicable to already existing indices, is based on three-terms local variance, i.e. computing variance over three-years-long, movable windows. We demonstrate these methods using simulations and data from real plant communities under long-term directional changes, discussing when one approach can be preferred. We show that accounting for long-term temporal trends is necessary and that separation of effect of trends and year-to-year fluctuation provides a better understanding of ecological mechanisms and their connections with ecological theory.",10618.0,"Lepš, Jan:Götzenberger, Lars:Valencia Gomez, Enrique:De Bello, Francesco",Ecography,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Coherent randomness tests and computing the K-trivial sets,"We introduce Oberwolfach randomness, a notion within Demuth's framework of statistical tests with moving components, here the components' movement has to be coherent across levels. We show that a ML-random set computes all K-trivial sets if and only if it is not Oberwolfach random, and indeed there is a K-trivial set which is not computable from any Oberwolfach random set. We show that Oberwolfach random sets satisfy effective versions of almost-everywhere theorems of analysis, such as the Lebesgue density theorem and Doob's martingale convergence theorem. We also show that random sets which are not Oberwolfach random satisfy highness properties (such as LR-hardness) which mean they are close to computing the halting problem. A consequence of these results is that a ML-random set failing the effective version of Lebesgue's density theorem for closed sets must compute all K-trivial sets. Combined with a recent result by Day and Miller, this gives a positive solution to the ML-covering problem of algorithmic randomness. On the other hand these results settle stronger variants of the covering problem in the negative: no low ML-random set computes all K-trivial sets, and not every K-trivial set is computable from both halves of a random set.",0.0,"Bienvenu, Laurent:Greenberg, Noam:Kučera, Antonín:Nies, Andres:Turetsky, Dan",Journal of the European Mathematical Society,2,high,high,1,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Antifungal Polyamides of Hydroxycinnamic Acids from Sunflower Bee Pollen,"The aim of the bioassay-guided fractionation was the selection of the most potent group of compounds responsible for the protection of sunflower bee pollen grains. Synthesis of prospective antifungal polyamides of hydroxycinnamic acids was based on previous structural elucidation of ethanol soluble fraction by H-1,H-1-PFG-COSY, H-1,C-13-HSQC, FT-IR, FT-Raman, and LC-MS experiments. The main compounds found were tri-p-coumaroylspermidines accompanied by other HCAA of spermidine and putrescine. Several model HCAA derivatives were prepared to test their antifungal activity against widespread spoilage fungi (A. niger 42 CCM 8189, F. culmorum DMF 0103, and P. verrucosum DMF 0023). A. niger CCM 8189 and F. culmorum DMF 0103 exhibited higher resistance to the antifungal effects of hydroxycinnamic acid amides, whereas P. verrucosum DMF 0023 was the most sensitive strain. It has been discovered the effect of HCAA polarity on the role of secondary metabolites in the microbial protection of pollen grains.

Assessing the effects of neonicotinoid insecticide on the bivalve mollusc Mytilus galloprovincialis,"In the present work, the marine invertebrate Mytilus galloprovincialis was used as model organism to evaluate the toxic effects of the neonicotinoid Calypso 480 SC (CAL) following 20 days of exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of 7.77 mg L-1 (0.1% 96 h-LC50) and 77.70 mg L-1 (1% 96 h-LC50), and a recovery period of 10 days in uncontaminated seawater. Results revealed that exposure to both concentrations of CAL increased significantly mortality rate in the cells of haemolymph and digestive gland, while digestive gland cells were no longer able to regulate cell volume. Exposure significantly reduced haemolymph parameters (Cl, Na+), affected the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase of digestive gland and catalase of gill, and caused also histopathological alterations in digestive gland and gills. Main histological damages detected in mussels were lipofuscin accumulation, focal points of necrosis, mucous overproduction and infiltrative inflammations. Interestingly, alterations persisted after the recovery period in CAL-free water, especially for haemocyte parameters (K+, Na+, Ca2+, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose). A slight recovery of histological conditions was detected. These findings suggested that sub-chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide caused significant alterations in both cell and tissue parameters of M. galloprovincialis. Considering the ecologically and commercially important role of mussels in coastal waters, a potential risk posed by neonicotinoids to this essential aquatic resource can be highlighted.

Does First-Trimester Screening Modify the Natural History of Congenital Heart Disease? Analysis of Outcome of Regional Cardiac Screening at 2 Different Time Periods,"BACKGROUND: The study analyzed the impact of first-trimester screening on the spectrum of congenital heart defects (CHDs) later in pregnancy and on the outcome of fetuses and children born alive with a CHD. METHODS: The spectrum of CHDs, associated comorbidities, and outcome of fetuses, either diagnosed with a CHD in the first trimester (Group I, 127 fetuses) or only in the second-trimester screening (Group II, 344 fetuses), were analyzed retrospectively between 2007 and 2013. Second-trimester fetuses diagnosed with a CHD between 2007 and 2013 were also compared with Group III (532 fetuses diagnosed with a CHD in the second trimester from 1996 to 2001, the period before first-trimester screening was introduced). RESULTS: The spectrum of CHDs diagnosed in the first and second trimesters in the same time period differed significantly, with a greater number of comorbidities (P&lt, 0.0001), CHDs with univentricular outcome (P&lt, 0.0001), intrauterine deaths (P= 0.01), and terminations of pregnancy (P&lt, 0.0001) in Group I compared with Group II. In Group III, significantly more cases of CHDs with univentricular outcome (P&lt, 0.0001), intrauterine demise (P= 0.036), and early termination (P&lt, 0.0001) were identified compared with fetuses diagnosed with CHDs in the second trimester between 2007 and 2013. The spectrum of CHDs seen in the second-trimester groups differed after first-trimester screening was implemented. CONCLUSIONS: First-trimester screening had a significant impact on the spectrum of CHDs and the outcomes of pregnancies with CHDs diagnosed in the second trimester.

The colonisation of Czech travellers and expatriates living in the Czech Republic by colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and whole genome characterisation of E. coli isolates harbouring the mcr-1 genes on a plasmid or chromosome: A cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: Travellers were recognized as a risk cohort that can be colonized by mcr-1-mediated colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. We aimed to investigate the carriage of mcr-mediated colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in Czech travellers or expatriates residing temporarily in the Czech Republic. METHODS: Between August 2018 and September 2019, the stool samples were cultured in enrichment broth. The enriched cultures were tested for the presence of the mcr-1-8 genes and inoculated onto selective agar with colistin. Colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were tested for the presence of the mcr-1-8 genes, the mcr-positive isolates were characterised by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: From the 177 stool samples, 15 colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were cultured (7.9%), two of the E. coli isolates carried the mcr-1 gene (1.1%). In the E. coli multilocus sequence type (ST) 156, the mcr-1 gene was located in an ISApl1-mcr-1-orf-ISApl1 (Tn6330) and incorporated into the chromosome, in the E. coli ST23 isolate, the mcr-1 gene was harboured by the plasmid IncX4. Both of the mcr-1 positive E. coli isolates were multidrug-resistant and one isolate was an extended-spectrum β-lactamase producer (bla(CTX-M-27)).

Expansion of the fatty acyl reductase gene family shaped pheromone communication in Hymenoptera,"Fatty acyl reductases (FARs) are involved in the biosynthesis of fatty alcohols that serve a range of biological roles. Insects typically harbor numerous FAR gene family members. While some FARs are involved in pheromone biosynthesis, the biological significance of the large number of FARs in insect genomes remains unclear. Using bumble bee (Bombini) FAR expression analysis and functional characterization, hymenopteran FAR gene tree reconstruction, and inspection of transposable elements (TEs) in the genomic environment of FARs, we uncovered a massive expansion of the FAR gene family in Hymenoptera, presumably facilitated by TEs. The expansion occurred in the common ancestor of bumble bees and stingless bees (Meliponini). We found that bumble bee FARs from the expanded FAR-A ortholog group contribute to the species-specific pheromone composition. Our results indicate that expansion and functional diversification of the FAR gene family played a key role in the evolution of pheromone communication in Hymenoptera.",10608.0,"Tupec, Michal:Buček, Aleš:Janoušek, V.:Vogel, H.:Prchalová, Darina:Kindl, Jiří:Pavlíčková, Tereza:Wenzelová, P.:Jahn, Ullrich:Valterová, Irena:Pichová, Iva",eLife,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
A framework of attitudes towards technology in theory and practice,"A trend analysis of Eurobarometer data shows that attitudes towards science and technology are diversifying in the EU, with enthusiasm clearly losing out to more ambivalent stances.

Our results are in line with the commonly entertained hypothesis that definite descriptions convey uniqueness (if singular) or maximality (if plural), but fail to support two hypotheses about bare nominal interpretation, namely that singular bare nominals convey uniqueness (Dayal 2004) and that topical bare nominals convey uniqueness/maximality (Geist 2010, among many others). Uniqueness or maximality inferences are expected to arise via covert type-shifting under these approaches.

Their mobility was thus subject to government scrutiny. This study explores (a) how such control extended to both official and private travel and (b) the various reasons that led people to travel. To facilitate surveillance, the Qin and Han governments both demarcated their territory through administrative units and checkpoints, issued transit permits, and enforced strict laws controlling the flow of travelers. Such control meant that people required permission to travel on private business to manage family matters, seek employment, and perform various other tasks.

Different Reaction Specificities of F420H2-Dependent Reductases Facilitate Pyrrolobenzodiazepines and Lincomycin To Fit Their Biological Targets,"Antitumor pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs), lincosamide antibiotics, quorum-sensing molecule hormaomycin, and antimicrobial griselimycin are structurally and functionally diverse groups of actinobacterial metabolites. The common feature of these compounds is the incorporation of L-tyrosine- or L-leucine-derived 4-alkyl-L-proline derivatives (APDs) in their structures.

Specifically, the heterologous overproduction of six Apd6 enzymes demonstrated that Apd6 from the biosynthesis of PBDs and hormaomycin can reduce only an endocyclic imine double bond, whereas Apd6 LmbY and partially GriH from the biosyntheses of lincomycin and griselimycin, respectively, also reduce the more inert exocyclic double bond of the same 4-substituted Delta 1-pyrroline-2-carboxylic acid substrate, making LmbY and GriH unusual, if not unique, among reductases. Furthermore, the differences in the reaction specificity of the Apd6 reductases determine the formation of the fully saturated APD moiety of lincomycin versus the unsaturated APD moiety of PBDs, providing molecules with optimal shapes to bind their distinct biological targets. Moreover, the Apd6 reductases establish the first F420H2-dependent enzymes from the luciferase-like hydride transferase protein superfamily in the biosynthesis of bioactive molecules. Finally, our bioinformatics analysis demonstrates that Apd6 and their homologues, widely distributed within several bacterial phyla, play a role in the formation of novel yet unknown natural products with incorporated L-proline-like precursors and likely in the microbial central metabolism.",10606.0,"Steiningerová, Lucie:Kameník, Zdeněk:Gažák, Radek:Kadlčík, Stanislav:Bashiri, G.:Man, Petr:Kuzma, Marek:Pavlíková, Magdaléna:Janata, Jiří",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Success of cuckoo catfish brood parasitism reflects coevolutionary history and individual experience of their cichlid hosts,"Obligate brood parasites manipulate other species into raising their offspring. Avian and insect brood parasitic systems demonstrate how interacting species engage in reciprocal coevolutionary arms races through behavioral and morphological adaptations and counteradaptations. Mouthbrooding cichlid fishes are renowned for their remarkable evolutionary radiations and complex behaviors. In Lake Tanganyika, mouthbrooding cichlids are exploited by the only obligate nonavian vertebrate brood parasite, the cuckoo catfish Synodontis multipunctatus. We show that coevolutionary history and individual learning both have a major impact on the success of cuckoo catfish parasitism between coevolved sympatric and evolutionarily naïve allopatric cichlid species. The rate of cuckoo catfish parasitism in coevolved Tanganyikan hosts was 3 to 11 times lower than in evolutionarily naïve cichlids. Moreover, using experimental infections, we demonstrate that parasite egg rejection in sympatric hosts was much higher, leading to seven times greater parasite survival in evolutionarily naïve than sympatric hosts. However, a high rejection frequency of parasitic catfish eggs by coevolved sympatric hosts came at a cost of increased rejection of their own eggs. A significant cost of catfish parasitism was universal, except for coevolved sympatric cichlid species with previous experience of catfish parasitism, demonstrating that learning and individual experience both contribute to a successful host response.",10613.0,"Blažek, Radim:Polačik, Matej:Smith, Carl:Honza, Marcel:Meyer, A.:Reichard, Martin",Science Advances,2,high,high,1,0,medium,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Efficient Cu2+, Pb2+ and Ni2+ ion removal from wastewater using electrospun DTPA-modified chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibers","Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-modified chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibers (CS-DTPA/PEO NFs) were developed for enhanced heavy metal ion adsorption. These nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning, and their morphology and structure were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. The ability of CS-DTPA/PEO NFs to removing copper (Cu2+), lead (Pb2+) and nickel (Ni2+) ions from aqueous solutions was tested at room temperature. The effects of [DTPA]/[NH2] molar ratio, pH and initial concentration of metal ions on their absorption capacity were investigated to optimize process conditions, using pseudo-first and apparent-second-order, Boyd and intraparticle diffusion models to determine the rate-limiting step of metal ions adsorption. In turn, Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models were used to describe the experimental data. The results demonstrate a decrease in the ability of CS-DTPA/PEO NFs to adsorb metal ions in the following order: Cu2+&gt,Pb2+&gt,Ni2+. The adsorption equilibrium is established after 90 min from the first contact with solutions containing the metal ions, and data are described using the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximal adsorption capacities of CS-DTPA/PEO NFs for Cu2+, Pb2+ and Ni2+ions were 177, 142, 56 mg g−1, respectively.

Associations of Brain Atrophy and Cerebral Iron Accumulation at MRI with Clinical Severity in Wilson Disease,"Background: Abnormal findings at brain MRI in patients with neurologic Wilson disease (WD) are characterized by signal intensity changes and cerebral atrophy. T2 signal hypointensities and atrophy are largely irreversible with treatment, their relationship with -permanent disability has not been systematically investigated. Purpose: To investigate associations of regional brain atrophy and iron accumulation at MRI with clinical severity in participants with neurologic WD who are undergoing long-term anti-copper treatment. Materials and Methods: Participants with WD and controls were compared in a prospective study performed from 2015 to 2019. MRI at 3.0 T included three-dimensional T1-weighted and six-echo multigradient-echo pulse sequences for morphometry and quantitative susceptibility mapping, respectively. Neurologic severity was assessed with the Unified WD Rating Scale (UWDRS). Automated multi-atlas segmentation pipeline with dual contrast (susceptibility and T1) was used for the calculation of volumes and mean susceptibilities in deep gray matter nuclei. Additionally, whole-brain analysis using deformation and surface-based morphometry was performed. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to assess the association of regional volumes and susceptibilities with the UWDRS score. Results: Twenty-nine participants with WD (mean age, 47 years. 9 [standard deviation], 15 women) and 26 controls (mean age, 45 years. 12, 14 women) were evaluated. Whole-brain analysis demonstrated atrophy of the deep gray matter nuclei, brainstem, internal capsule, motor cortex and corticospinal pathway, and visual cortex and optic radiation in participants with WD (P &gt, .05 at voxel level, corrected for family-wise error). The UWDRS score was negatively correlated with volumes of putamen (r = .0.63, P &gt, .001), red nucleus (r = .0.58, P = .001), globus pallidus (r = .0.53, P = .003), and substantia nigra (r = .0.50, P = .006) but not with susceptibilities. Only the putaminal volume was identified as a stable factor associated with the UWDRS score (R-2 = 0.38, P &gt, .001) using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Conclusion: Individuals with Wilson disease (WD) had widespread brain atrophy most pronounced in the central structures. The putaminal volume was associated with the Unified WD Rating Scale score and can be used as a surrogate imaging marker of clinical severity.

Strigolactones inhibit auxin feedback on PIN-dependent auxin transport canalization,"Directional transport of the phytohormone auxin is a versatile, plant-specific mechanism regulating many aspects of plant development. The recently identified plant hormones, strigolactones (SLs), are implicated in many plant traits, among others, they modify the phenotypic output of PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporters for fine-tuning of growth and developmental responses. Here, we show in pea and Arabidopsis that SLs target processes dependent on the canalization of auxin flow, which involves auxin feedback on PIN subcellular distribution. D14 receptor- and MAX2 F-box-mediated SL signaling inhibits the formation of auxin-conducting channels after wounding or from artificial auxin sources, during vasculature de novo formation and regeneration. At the cellular level, SLs interfere with auxin effects on PIN polar targeting, constitutive PIN trafficking as well as clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our results identify a non-transcriptional mechanism of SL action, uncoupling auxin feedback on PIN polarity and trafficking, thereby regulating vascular tissue formation and regeneration.",10611.0,"Zhang, Jing:Mazur, Ewa:Balla, Jozef:Gallei, Michelle:Kalousek, Petr:Medveďová, Zuzana:Li, Yang:Wang, Yaping:Prát, Tomáš:Vasileva, Mina:Reinöhl, Vilém:Procházka, Stanislav:Halouzka, Rostislav:Tarkowski, Petr:Luschnig, Christian:Brewer, Philip B.:Friml, Jiří",Nature Communications,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Breathing Out Completely Before Inhalation: The Most Problematic Step in Application Technique in Patients With Non-Mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Background: Patient adherence to an inhaled medication application technique (A-AppIT) represents a major health-care issue in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, there is a lack of studies evaluating this issue thoroughly. The aim of our study was to introduce a universal easy-to-use method of assessing the A-AppIT to chronic medication in moderate to very severe COPD individuals. Methods: The Czech Multicenter Research Database of COPD (COPD CMRD), a large observational prospective study, was used as a source of clinical data. A-AppIT was evaluated using our Five Steps Assessment. This measure is based on dichotomous evaluation of each of five predefined consecutive application technique steps and can be used in all settings for all currently available inhalation systems in COPD subjects. Results: A total of 546 participants (75.0% men, mean age 66.7 years, mean forced expiratory volume in 1s 44.7%) were available for analysis. This represents 69.6% of all patients recruited in the COPD CMRD. Less than one third of patients presented their application technique without any erroneous steps. The most problematic steps were breathing out completely in one breath immediately before inhalation (step No. 3), and the actual inhalation maneuver (step No. 4). The total number of errors was similar for dry powder inhalers and pressurized metered-dose inhalers. Conclusion: Our novel instrument, Five Steps Assessment, is comfortable for use in routine clinical practice to explore A-AppIT.

New Soft Theorems for Goldstone-Boson Amplitudes,"In this Letter we discuss new soft theorems for the Goldstone-boson amplitudes with nonvanishing soft limits. The standard argument is that the nonlinearly realized shift symmetry leads to the vanishing of scattering amplitudes in the soft limit, known as the Adler zero. This statement involves certain assumptions of the absence of cubic vertices and the absence of linear terms in the transformations of fields. For theories which fail to satisfy these conditions, we derive a new soft theorem which involves certain linear combinations of lower point amplitudes, generalizing the Adler zero statement. We provide an explicit example of the SU(N)/SU(N - 1) sigma model which was also recently studied in the context of U(1) fibrated models. The soft theorem can be then used as an input into the modified soft recursion relations for the reconstruction of all tree-level amplitudes.",10303.0,"Kampf, Karol:Novotný, Jiří:Shifman, Mikhail:Trnka, Jaroslav",Physical Review Letters,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Early Pennsylvanian ombrotrophic mire of the Prokop Coal (Upper Silesian Basin), what does it say about climate?","The Lower Pennsylvanian (Kinderscoutian) Prokop Coal (Coal No. 40), the erosional remnant of which covers about 5000 km(2), is the thickest seam of the Upper Silesian Basin situated along the Czech - Polish border. This basin-wide coal is unusual in its thickness and high inertinite and very low ash contents. In the Czech sector, this coal merges with the overlying Coal No. 39 into a single 9 to 15 m thick seam. Maceral analyses of an approximately 11 m thick section of these two merged coals show changes in the proportion of vitrinite (24.7 - 88.0%) and inertinite (8.5 - 56.8%) in cycles between 50 and 190 cm thick. The increase of inertinite in the lower part of coal cycles coincides with a dulling-upward trend, which records a drying-upward succession due to a slowing of accommodation rate relative to plant biomass productivity. This succession is interpreted as a transition from rheotrophic to ombrotrophic conditions. The brightening-upward succession in the upper part of coal cycles records a wetting-upward trend due to water table rise, resulting in restoration of rheotrophic conditions that supported humification under the regional ground water table. The sudden shift from inertinite-rich to vitrinite-rich coal at the base of brightening-upward successions points to a period of degradation and lowering of the peat dome. The coal cycles within the studied seam section probably preserve a succession of spatially overlapping but genetically independent mires bounded by degradation surfaces. The alternation between mires with contrasting hydrological regimes is interpreted as a record of base-level fluctuations of climatic causation of sub-Milankovitch periodicities. Early Pennsylvanian climate for various stages of mire development is inferred from analogy with modem tropical mires in SE Asia.",10505.0,"Opluštil, Stanislav:Sýkorová, Ivana",International Journal of Coal Geology,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Resisting Mandatory Vaccination: the Formation of the ""Informed Parent"" in the Czech Republic","Czech Republic belongs among countries with rigid mandatory vaccination system regulated by the state. To let children vaccinate is considered as an unquestionable norm supported by formal sanctions for those who would not take part in such practice. This paper focuses on parents who challenge such norm with their decision to refuse their child&apos,s immunization. Twenty-two parents whose children were not vaccinated were interviewed and several participant observations were conducted at public lectures concerning immunization and on meetings of parent who actively take part in the debates against compulsory vaccination. Firstly, the paper examines how the parents&apos, attitudes to health, body and biomedicine become integrated into their attitudes toward vaccination. It uses the concept of biological citizenship to analyze how the attitudes toward biomedicine and vaccination serve as a foundation for the formation of new biosocialities. It shows how the debates concerning vaccination give rise to subjectivities of parents who claim specific rights based on shared definitions of risk, stances towards biomedicine and notions of individual responsibility towards one&apos,s own health. Those parents consciously and systematically construct their own credibility as &quot,informed parents&quot, that is used as key resource while legitimizing their decision. Secondly, the paper focuses on the conditions of emergence and existence of anti-vaccination movement in the Czech society. It maps how the collective identity of parents becomes articulated through the attitudes toward biomedicine and vaccination. The paper explores the ways in which parental attitudes towards vaccination facilitates emergence of novel forms of collectivities that allow for generating new and alternative forms of knowledge and resistance against the dominant biomedical knowledge.",50401.0,"Hasmanová Marhánková, Jaroslava",Rebellious Parents.

Docosahexaenoic Acid–Derived Fatty Acid Esters of Hydroxy Fatty Acids (FAHFAs) With Anti-inflammatory Properties,"White adipose tissue (WAT) is a complex organ with both metabolic and endocrine functions. Dysregulation of all of these functions of WAT, together with low-grade inflammation of the tissue in obese individuals, contributes to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of marine origin play an important role in the resolution of inflammation and exert beneficial metabolic effects. Using experiments in mice and overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes, we elucidated the structures of novel members of fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids—lipokines derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and linoleic acid, which were present in serum and WAT after n-3 PUFA supplementation. These compounds contained DHA esterified to 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HLA) or 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (HDHA), termed 9-DHAHLA, 13-DHAHLA, and 14-DHAHDHA, and were synthesized by adipocytes at concentrations comparable to those of protectins and resolvins derived from DHA in WAT. 13-DHAHLA exerted anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties while reducing macrophage activation by lipopolysaccharides and enhancing the phagocytosis of zymosan particles.

Knowledge Transfer from Detailed 3-D CFD Codes to System Simulation Tools –CCV Modeling in SI Engine,"The paper deals with CCV knowledge transfer from reference data (either experiments or 3-D CFD data) into system simulation SW tools (based on 0-D/1-D CFD). It was verified that CCV phenomenon can be modeled by means of combustion model perturbations. The proposed methodology consists of two major steps. First, individual cycle data have to be matched with the 0-D/1-D model, i.e., combustion model parameters are varied to achieve the best possible match of in-cylinder pressure traces. Second, the combustion model parameters (obtained in previous step) are statistically evaluated to obtain PDFs and cross-correlations. Then such information is imposed to the 0-D/1-D tool to mimic pressure traces CCV. Good correspondence with the reference data is achieved only if both PDFs and cross-correlations are imposed simultaneously. Different engine operating points were evaluated to draw some general conclusions in terms of CCV. It was confirmed that turbulence properties and initial flame kernel development are the dominant factors. However, these factors are neither independent nor random – they seem to be correlated. Operating points with high CCV are more organized in terms of the statistics – they exhibit strong cross-correlations of combustion model parameters.",0.0,"Vítek, Oldřich:Macek, Jan:Poetsch, Ch.",MECCA Journal of Middle European Construction and Design of Cars,2,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Isogenic lines in fish - a critical review,"An isogenic line is a group of animals with an identical genotype, and its use is widely accepted for bioresearch standardization. Isogenic lines in fish can be generated within two generations via uniparental inheritance and can facilitate studies for which standardization and consistency are required. The availability and use of isogenic lines is limited, but isogenic lines in some fish species have been generated. Their power has been demonstrated in fields including human disease modelling, drug development, toxicology and also sequencing projects. The genetic basis of desired traits in aquaculture species can be identified using isogenic lines, which, in turn, will help to improve fish culture.

The long-term impact of the resettlement of the Sudetenland on residential migration,"We analyze the long-term impact of the resettlement of the Sudetenland after World War II on residential migration. This event involved expulsion of ethnic Germans and an almost complete depopulation of an area of a country and its rapid resettlement by 2 million Czech inhabitants. Results based on a regression discontinuity design show a highly persistent higher population churn and thus a lower attachment of residents to their region in resettled areas. Descriptive evidence also indicates that resettled settlements still have fewer local club memberships, less frequently organize local social events and had lower turnout in municipal elections until the 1990s. This thus suggests persistently lower levels of local social capital. This finding is consistent with recent theoretical models that suggest a highly persistent impact of the destruction of local social capital on residential migration.",50202.0,"Guzi, Martin:Huber, Peter:Mikula, Štěpán",Journal of Urban Economics,2,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
BoxCars: Improving Fine-Grained Recognition of Vehicles using 3-D Bounding Boxes in Traffic Surveillance,"In this paper, we focus on fine-grained recognition of vehicles mainly in traffic surveillance applications. We propose an approach that is orthogonal to recent advancements in fine-grained recognition (automatic part discovery, bilinear pooling). Also, in contrast to other methods focused on fine-grained recognition of vehicles, we do not limit ourselves to a frontal/rear viewpoint, but allow the vehicles to be seen from any viewpoint. Our approach is based on 3D bounding boxes built around the vehicles. The bounding box can be automatically constructed from traffic surveillance data. For scenarios where it is not possible to use precise construction, we propose a method for an estimation of the 3D bounding box. The 3D bounding box is used to normalize the image viewpoint by ""unpacking"" the image into a plane. We also propose to randomly alter the color of the image and add a rectangle with random noise to a random position in the image during the training of Convolutional Neural Networks. We have collected a large fine-grained vehicle dataset BoxCars116k, with 116k images of vehicles from various viewpoints taken by numerous surveillance cameras. We performed a number of experiments which show that our proposed method significantly improves CNN classification accuracy (the accuracy is increased by up to 12 percentage points and the error is reduced by up to 50% compared to CNNs without the proposed modifications). We also show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for fine-grained recognition.",10201.0,"Sochor, Jakub:Špaňhel, Jakub:Herout, Adam",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS,2,high,high,1,1,high,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Beckett's 'Mongrel Mime' : Politics and Poetics,"This article analyses Beckett's unpublished and unperformed prison play ‘Mongrel Mime’, written for ex-San Quentin inmate Rick Cluchey in 1982–83.

Hemodynamic Response to Gabapentin in Conscious Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats: The Role of Sympathetic Nervous System,"Ligands of auxiliary (2) subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) decrease elevated L-type VDCCs surface expression in arterial myocytes and arterial constriction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). However, their effect on blood pressure (BP) is unclear. In this study, we investigated the hemodynamic response to acute and chronic administration of gabapentin, a ligand of auxiliary (2) subunit of VDCCs, in adult SHR with established neurogenic hypertension. The acute gabapentin administration lowered BP and heart rate more in conscious SHR than Wistar-Kyoto rats. Both nifedipine (L-type VDCCs blocker) and -conotoxin GVIA (N-type VDCCs blocker) also decreased BP more in SHR, but only gabapentin and -conotoxin GVIA abolished the nitroprusside-induced reflex tachycardia of baroreceptor-heart rate control. Hypotensive effect of gabapentin was accompanied by a reduction of (1) plasma norepinephrine level, (2) depressor response to ganglionic blocker pentolinium, (3) power of low frequency component of systolic BP variability, and (4) pressor response of mesenteric vascular bed to periarterial nerve stimulation, suggesting the decrease of peripheral sympathetic nerve transmission. Moreover, gabapentin effects on BP and baroreflex were absent in sympathectomized rats. In conclusion, the acute (but not chronic) administration of gabapentin lowered BP more in SHR than in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Besides the known L-type VDCCs involvement in the vascular effect of gabapentin, our data revealed the important role of N-type VDCCs in acute gabapentin effect on sympathetic control of BP.

Effect of mixed vs single brine composition on salt weathering in porous carbonate building stones for different environmental conditions,"The influence of different factors, brine composition, environmental conditions and pore structure, on salt weathering of porous carbonate building stones is investigated. The main goal of this study is to highlight the differences in weathering between single salts and a mixture of different salts. Two kinds of weathering mechanism are studied, the crystallization pressure and the deliquescence/recrystallization process. To achieve this purpose wetting and drying cycles and cycles varying relative humidity on samples containing salts were performed. The effect of total salt content with different salts and mixtures is simulated by weathering tests with solution of different compositions (NaCl, 6% in weight, Na2SO410H2O, 6% in weight, CaSO4 at saturation, and a mixture of them at total concentration of 6.2%). Weathering tests were performed at room temperature and 50 °C and under low and high relative humidity. The results show that the final weathering depends on a complex combination of three parameters: (i) environmental conditions, (ii) salt composition and (iii) petrophysical properties of stones, and general conclusions on the impact of each parameter can be drawn. An important result is that salt mixtures have a lesser impact on weathering during crystallization cycles: single salt brines, especially sodiumsulphate, producemoreweathering than complex brine compositions duringwetting and drying cycles. Conversely during variations on RH, samples with salt mixtures suffer more damage than samples weathered with a brine of single salt composition.",0.0,"Menéndez, B.:Petráňová, Veronika",Engineering Geology,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Speech Biomarkers in Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder and Parkinson Disease,"Objective: This multilanguage study used simple speech recording and high-end pattern analysis to provide sensitive and reliable noninvasive biomarkers of prodromal versus manifest α-synucleinopathy in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and early-stage Parkinson disease (PD). Methods: We performed a multicenter study across the Czech, English, German, French, and Italian languages at 7 centers in Europe and North America. A total of 448 participants (337 males), including 150 with iRBD (mean duration of iRBD across language groups 0.5-3.4 years), 149 with PD (mean duration of disease across language groups 1.7-2.5 years), and 149 healthy controls were recorded, 350 of the participants completed the 12-month follow-up. We developed a fully automated acoustic quantitative assessment approach for the 7 distinctive patterns of hypokinetic dysarthria. Results: No differences in language that impacted clinical parkinsonian phenotypes were found. Compared with the controls, we found significant abnormalities of an overall acoustic speech severity measure via composite dysarthria index for both iRBD (p = 0.002) and PD (p &lt, 0.001). However, only PD (p &lt, 0.001) was perceptually distinct in a blinded subjective analysis. We found significant group differences between PD and controls for monopitch (p &lt, 0.001), prolonged pauses (p &lt, 0.001), and imprecise consonants (p = 0.03), only monopitch was able to differentiate iRBD patients from controls (p = 0.004). At the 12-month follow-up, a slight progression of overall acoustic speech impairment was noted for the iRBD (p = 0.04) and PD (p = 0.03) groups.

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II,"Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the assembly of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the photosynthesis-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII assembly. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a Synechocystis PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the chlorophyll-binding PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D gel electrophoresis, we identified a pigmented Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 binds to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the synthesis of this chlorophyll-binding polypeptide until the attachment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the synthesis of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing chlorophyll biosynthesis. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes membrane segments of CP47 and facilitates the insertion of chlorophyll molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.",10606.0,"Bučinská, Lenka:Kiss, Eva:Koník, Peter:Knoppová, Jana:Komenda, Josef:Sobotka, Roman",Plant Physiology,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Preconditioning methods for eddy-current optimally controlled time-harmonic electromagnetic problems,"Time-harmonic problems arise in many important applications, such as eddy current optimally controlled electromagnetic problems. Eddy current modelling can also be used in non-destructive testings of conducting materials. Using a truncated Fourier series to approximate the solution, for linear problems the equation for different frequencies separate, so it suffices to study solution methods for the problem for a single frequency. The arising discretized system takes a two-by-two or four-by-four block matrix form. Since the problems are in general three-dimensional in space and hence of very large scale, one must use an iterative solution method. It is then crucial to construct efficient preconditioners. It is then crucial to construct efficient preconditioners. It is shown that an earlier used preconditioner for optimal control problems is applicable here also and leads to very tight eigenvalue bounds and hence very fast convergence such as for a Krylov subspace iterative solution method.

"Insecticides alter prey choice of potential biocontrol agent Philodromus cespitum (Araneae, Philodromidae)","Even though pesticides can have various sublethal effects on behaviour of biocontrol agents, no study to date has investigated the effects of pesticides on the prey choice of generalist predators. Prey choice of generalist predators is among key factors determining the predation pressure they exert on pests, because it influences fitness of predators and consequently their densities and per capita capture rate. Here, we investigated the effect of Integro (a.i. methoxyfenozide) and SpinTor 480 Sc (a.i. spinosad) on prey choice and predatory activity of the spider Philodromus cespitum, which is known significantly to reduce hemipteran and dipteran pests in fruit orchards. We compared the prey preferences of philodromids between the psyllid pest Cacopsylla pyri (Hemiptera, Psyllidae) and beneficial Theridion sp. spiders in laboratory experiments. We found that both pesticides altered the prey preferences of philodromids. While the philodromids in a control treatment preferred theridiid spiders over the psyllid pest, philodromids in the pesticide treatments exhibited no significant prey preferences. The changes in prey preferences were caused by increased predation on the psyllids, while the predation on the theridiid remained similar. We suggest that the changes in prey preferences might theoretically be due to 1) impaired sensory systems, 2) altered taste, and/or 3) altered mobility. In combination with other studies finding reduced predation on fruit flies in P. cespitum after exposure to SpinTor, our results indicate that the sublethal effects of pesticides on predatory behaviour of generalist predators can depend on prey type and/or prey community composition.",10616.0,"Petcharad, Booppa:Košulič, Ondřej:Michalko, Radek",Chemosphere,2,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon accumulation in aged and unaged polyurethane microplastics in contaminated soil,"The interaction of microplastics (MPs) and common environmental organic pollutants has been a frequently discussed topic in recent years. Although the estimated contamination caused by MPs in terrestrial ecosystems is one order of magnitude higher than that in the oceans, experiments have been conducted solely in an aqueous matrix. Therefore, an experiment was carried outwith two soils differing in their concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polyurethane foams used for scent fences along roads and crop fields. Two types of polyurethane foam (biodegradable and conventional in aged and unaged form) were exposed to soils containing PAHs that originated from historically contaminated localities. The exposure lasted 28 days, and a newly developed three-step procedure to separateMPs from soil was then applied. Biodegradable polyurethane MPs exhibited a strong tendency to accumulate PAHs after 7 days, and their concentrations significantly grew over time. In contrast, the sorption of PAHs on conventional polyurethane MPs was substantially lower (a maximumof 3.6 times higher concentration than that in the soil). Neither type of foamchanged their sorption behaviors after the aging procedure. The results indicate that the flexibility of the polyurethane polymeric network could be the main driving factor for the sorption.",20801.0,"Černá, Tereza:Pražanová, K.:Beneš, Hynek:Titov, Ivan:Klubalová, Kateřina:Filipová, Alena:Klusoň, Petr:Cajthaml, Tomáš",Science of the Total Environment,2,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Neuroimaging of epilepsy,"Imaging is pivotal in the evaluation and management of patients with seizure disorders. Elegant structural neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may assist in determining the etiology of focal epilepsy and demonstrating the anatomical changes associated with seizure activity. The high diagnostic yield of MRI to identify the common pathological findings in individuals with focal seizures including mesial temporal sclerosis, vascular anomalies, low-grade glial neoplasms and malformations of cortical development has been demonstrated. Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most commonly performed interictal functional neuroimaging technique that may reveal a focal hypometabolic region concordant with seizure onset. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies may assist performance of ictal neuroimaging in patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy being considered for neurosurgical treatment.

"Forest Soil Bacteria: Diversity, Involvement in Ecosystem Processes, and Response to Global Change","The ecology of forest soils is an important field of research due to the role of forests as carbon sinks. Consequently, a significant amount of information has been accumulated concerning their ecology, especially for temperate and boreal forests. Although most studies have focused on fungi, forest soil bacteria also play important roles in this environment. In forest soils, bacteria inhabit multiple habitats with specific properties, including bulk soil, rhizosphere, litter, and deadwood habitats, where their communities are shaped by nutrient availability and biotic interactions. Bacteria contribute to a range of essential soil processes involved in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. They take part in the decomposition of dead plant biomass and are highly important for the decomposition of dead fungal mycelia. In rhizospheres of forest trees, bacteria interact with plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi as commensalists or mycorrhiza helpers. Bacteria also mediate multiple critical steps in the nitrogen cycle, including N fixation. Bacterial communities in forest soils respond to the effects of global change, such as climate warming, increased levels of carbon dioxide, or anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. This response, however, often reflects the specificities of each studied forest ecosystem, and it is still impossible to fully incorporate bacteria into predictive models. The understanding of bacterial ecology in forest soils has advanced dramatically in recent years, but it is still incomplete. The exact extent of the contribution of bacteria to forest ecosystem processes will be recognized only in the future, when the activities of all soil community members are studied simultaneously.",10606.0,"Lladó, Salvador:López-Mondéjar, Rubén:Baldrian, Petr",Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews,2,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Structure of a monolayer of molecular rotors on aqueous subphase from grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction,"In situ grazing-incidence X-ray scattering shows that a monolayer of artificial rod-shaped dipolar molecular rotors produced on the surface of an aqueous subphase in a Langmuir trough has a structure conducive to a 2D ferroelectric phase. The axes of the rotors stand an average of 0.83 nm apart in a triangular grid, perpendicular to the surface within experimental error. They carry 2,3-dichlorophenylene rotators near rod centers, between two decks of interlocked triptycenes installed axially on the rotor axle. The analysis is based first on simultaneous fitting of observed Bragg rods and second on fitting the reflectivity curve with only three adjustable parameters and the calculated rotor electron density, which also revealed the presence of about seven molecules of water near each rotator.

Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: Perspectives in Diagnosis and Management,"Awareness of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) as a unique disease entity dates back to the 18th century. Since then, numerous inciting agents have been attributed to inducing HP, and the pathogenesis of the disease is now better understood. HP is a disease of many facets and phenotypes, making its recognition and differentiation from other interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) challenging, in particular idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The clinician is often unable to distinguish features of chronic HP (CHP) from those of IPF, and some patients meeting the 2011 criteria for the diagnosis of IPF may in fact have CHP with pulmonary fibrosis. The high rate of screen failures in patients participating in IPF clinical trials highlights this diagnostic challenge, as pulmonologists may be misdiagnosing patients with CHP as having IPF, overlooking environmental factors that can contribute to the disease. Despite recent data and reports suggesting new directions in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HP, there remain substantial gaps in knowledge of epidemiology, pathogenesis, optimal diagnostic approach, and, ultimately, classification of this disease. Consensus among experts for diagnosis, treatment, and management are lacking, and the need for consensus guidelines is evident. In this Perspective, we propose diagnostic criteria and a novel classification of HP based on a combination of international clinical experience and available evidence. We believe that these criteria will be of use to the pulmonologist when confronted with patients suspected of having HP and promote further study to increase our understanding of how HP should be managed. The proposed criteria need to be validated in further studies, and therefore should not be interpreted as a guideline recommendation.",30203.0,"Vašáková, Martina:Morell, Ferran:Walsh, Simon:Leslie, Kevin:Raghu, Ganesh",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,2,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Effects of bark beetle disturbance on soil nutrient retention and lake chemistry in glacial catchment,"Forest ecosystems worldwide are subjected to human-induced stressors, including eutrophication and acidification, and to natural disturbances (e.g. insect infestation, windstorms, fires). The occurrence of the later is expected to increase due to the ongoing climate change. These multi-stressor forcings modify ecosystem biogeochemistry, including the retention of limiting nutrients, with implications for terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity. Here we present whole ecosystem nutrient (N, Ca, Mg, K) mass balances in the forested catchment of Plešné Lake, CZ, which has undergone transient changes linked to the recovery from anthropogenic acidification and to the forest disturbances caused by severe infestations by the bark beetle (Ips typographus). Measured fluxes and storage of nutrients in the lake-catchment ecosystem were used to constrain the process-oriented biogeochemical model MAGIC (Model of Acidification of Groundwater In Catchments). Simulated lake water chemistry and changes in soil nutrient pools fitted observed data and revealed that i) the ecosystem N retention declined, thus nitrate leaching increased for 10 years following the bark beetle disturbance, with transient adverse effects on the acid-base status of lake water, ii) the kinetics of nutrient mineralisation from decaying biomass coupled with nutrient immobilisation in regrowing vegetation constrained the magnitude and duration of ecosystem losses of N,  Ca and Mg, iii) the excess of mineralised base cations from decomposing biomass replenished the soil cation exchange matrix, which led to increased soil base saturation, and iv) the improvement of the catchment soil acid-base status led to an increase of lake water pH and acid neutralising capacity. Forested ecosystems underlain by nutrient-poor soils and bedrock are prone to human-induced damages caused by acidification and eutrophication, and any natural disturbance may further lead to nutrient imbalances. We demonstrated that in this natural forest ecosystem protected from human intervention, disturbances together with natural post-disturbance vegetation recovery have temporally positive effects on the nutrient stores in the soil.",10511.0,"Hruška, Jakub:Oulehle, Filip:Wright, Richard:Svoboda, Miroslav:Bače, Radek:Matějka, Karel:Kaňa, Jiří:Couture, Raoul-Marie:Kopáček, Jiří",Ecosystems,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Critical Review Biogeochemical Networking of Iron in Constructed Wetlands for Wastewater Treatment,"Iron is present in all types of wastewater: however, besides acid mine drainage, where it is a major constituent of concern, it is usually neglected in other types of wastewaters. In all kinds of constructed wetlands, iron plays important role in removal of organics and phosphorus, and it has an impact on transformation of nitrogen, sulfur, and metals. The biogeochemistry of iron is well understood in natural wetlands, but knowledge about iron impact on microbiological and chemical transformations during wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands is very limited. So far, the sparse research in this area provides limited information on observed interactions with several varying parameters across the studies, making it difficult to draw fundamental and mechanistic conclusions. A critical review of the complex biogeochemical networking of iron in CWs is therefore necessary to fill the gap in knowledge on the role of iron and its biogeochemical multi interactions in wastewater treatment processes of CW",10503.0,"Wu, Shubiao:Vymazal, Jan:Brix, Hans",Environmental Science & Technology,2,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cell wall contributes to the stability of plasma membrane nanodomain organization of Arabidopsis thaliana FLOTILLIN2 and HYPERSENSITIVE INDUCED REACTION1 proteins,"Current models of plasma membrane (PM) postulate its organization in various nano- and micro-domains with distinct protein and lipid composition. While metazoan PM nanodomains usually display high lateral mobility, the dynamics of plant nanodomains is often highly spatially restricted. Here we have focused on the determination of the PM distribution in nanodomains for Arabidopsis thaliana flotillin (AtFLOT) and hypersensitive induced reaction proteins (AtHIR), previously shown to be involved in response to extracellular stimuli. Using in vivo laser scanning and spinning disc confocal microscopy in Arabidopsis thaliana we present here their nanodomain localization in various epidermal cell types. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and kymographic analysis revealed that PM-associated AtFLOTs contain significantly higher immobile fraction than AtHIRs. In addition, much lower immobile fractions have been found in tonoplast pool of AtHIR3. Although members of both groups of proteins were spatially restricted in their PM distribution by corrals co-aligning with microtubules (MTs), pharmacological treatments showed no or very low role of actin and microtubular cytoskeleton for clustering of AtFLOT and AtHIR into nanodomains. Finally, pharmacological alteration of cell wall (CW) synthesis and structure resulted in changes in lateral mobility of AtFLOT2 and AtHIR1. Accordingly, partial enzymatic CW removal increased the overall dynamics as well as individual nanodomain mobility of these two proteins. Such structural links to CW could play an important role in their correct positioning during PM communication with extracellular environment.",10609.0,"Daněk, Michal:Angelini, J.:Malínská, Kateřina:Andrejch, J.:Amlerová, J.:Kocourková, Daniela:Brouzdová, Jitka:Valentová, O.:Martinec, Jan:Petrášek, Jan",Plant Journal,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Predictors for Intracranial Hemorrhage Following Intravenous Thrombolysis in Posterior Circulation Stroke,"Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is a standard treatment for anterior (ACS) and posterior circulation stroke (PCS). However, due to the low occurrence of PCS and of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in PCS, the knowledge about ICH predictors following IVT in PCS is sparse. Our aim was to identify predictors for ICH following IVT in PCS. The set consisted of 1281 consecutive ischemic stroke (IS) patients treated with IVT, out of which 158 (103 males, mean age 65.6 ± 12.3 years) had PCS. Collected data include baseline characteristics, common stroke risk factors, pre-medication, stroke severity, admission blood glucose level, blood pressure and treatment with intravenous antihypertensive therapy before and during IVT, occlusion of arteries, recanalization rate, time to treatment, and clinical outcome at day 90. Overall, 11 (7%) patients had ICH. Atrial fibrillation (p = 0.004), neurological deficit at time of treatment in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (p = 0.016), decreased level of consciousness (p = 0.003), occlusion of basilar artery (p = 0.007), occlusion of PCA (p = 0.001), and additional endovascular therapy (p = 0.001) were identified by logistic regression analysis as significant predictors for ICH in PCS. Patients with ischemic lesion in the brainstem, occlusion of vertebral artery, or absence of basilar and posterior cerebral artery occlusion might be considered for treatment with IVT even in borderline cases. Those patients seem to have less frequently favorable outcomes without an increase in ICH rate. Time to IVT in PCS seems not to influence ICH risk or chances for favorable outcomes as significantly as it does in ACS.",30210.0,"Dorňák, Tomáš:Král, Michal:Sedláčková, Zuzana:Šaňák, Daniel:Čecháková, Eva:Divišová, Petra:Zapletalová, Jana:Kaňovský, Petr",Translational Stroke Research,2,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Systemic rejection: political pressures seen from the science system,"The emphasis on competitiveness and the knowledge-based economy in European policymaking has resulted in a heightened focus on monitoring and steering the science system, particularly through metric-based instruments. Policymakers&apos, general aims of fostering excellent research and breakthroughs are shared by researchers as well, however, below the surface is a paradox that is rarely discussed. The political system and the science system understand and pursue these concepts and objectives differently. Through two case studies on high-performing university-based research environments in Denmark and Sweden, this article uncovers the ways in which highly successful researchers often behave in ways that run counter to policy steering attempts. They do this by shielding themselves and their research group from steering pressures originating in the political system. Using Luhmann&apos,s systems theory, the cases demonstrate why the relationship between the science system and the political system needs to be understood as a horizontal rather than a vertical relationship, and using concepts from organizational theory, provides a model and terminology for identifying and analyzing the types of mechanisms and strategic responses that the science system uses to shield itself from political steering pressures.",50601.0,"Young, Mitchell:Sørensen, Mads P.:Bloch, Carter:Degn, Lise",Higher Education,2,high,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Devonian (Lochkovian – early Emsian) bioevents and conodont response in the Prague Synform (Czech Republic),"The Devonian succession of the Prague Synform is characterized by two major lithofacies: shallow-water biodetrital, mostly crinoidal limestones that also include a reefal skeletal accumulation of Pragian age, and a more pelagic facies that is represented mostly by calcisiltites. Among the several Devonian prominent sea-level fluctuations, some can be traced globally, e.g., the Basal Pragian and Kačák events. In recent years, conodont biostratigraphy of the Early Devonian (Lochkovian, Pragian and early Emsian) of the Prague Synform has been refined. The regional subdivision of the Lower Devonian in its type area has been greatly improved by the integration of new biostratigraphic, chemostratigraphic, sedimentological, and petrophysical data that has, in turn, strengthened global correlations for this interval in Earth's history. The complete conodont biozonation of the Early Devonian interval (basal Lochkovian – earliest Emsian) in the Prague Synform includes 17 biozones, which can be applied to sections representing various depositional environments and have more global applicability than previously proposed ‘global’ conodont biozonations. The zonal scale enables a precise biostratigraphic delimitation of the major Early Devonian biotic events (Silurian-Devonian Boundary Event, Lochkovian-Pragian Event and Basal Zlichovian Event). There were major changes in the conodont fauna in response to the Silurian-Devonian Boundary and Lochkovian-Pragian events, however the Basal Zlichovian Event was only characterized by a very gradual transition in the conodont fauna. In parallel to the traditional events defined for the Prague Synform, seven other significant conodont events have been documented. These events represent major turnovers in the conodont fauna that have a direct impact on conodont biostratigraphy, specifically at a global scale. The Icriodus and Irregularis events are congruent with the lower boundaries of the Lochkovian and Pragian stages, respectively. The conodont events established in the Prague Synform largely reflect variations in the seawater depth but are generally independent of lithological changes within sections of the Prague Synform.",10506.0,"Slavík, Ladislav:Hladil, Jindřich","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology",2,low,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dosimetry in mixed neutron-gamma fields with a Timepix detector,"We used the hybrid semiconductor pixel detector Timepix as an area dosimeter in mixed neutron-gamma fields.

We used three different neutron sources for calibration of the device – thermal neutrons from graphite pile, 241Am-Be and 252Cf. The desired neutron component of dosimetry and operational quantities can be determined by counting events under the converters. The segmentation of the Timepix detector and its capability to measure energy deposition of each interacting quantum of ionizing radiation allows a separation of neutron events from X-ray/gamma or electron interaction. Thus, the device can also be used for simultaneous X-ray and gamma dosimetry, where it is in some aspects superior to most of the commercial devices, given its detection threshold of 3–5 keV.",10304.0,"Ekendahl, Daniela:Rubovič, Peter:Hůlka, Jiří:Vykydal, Zdeněk:Bergmann, B.:Pospíšil, S.:Štekl, I.",Radiation Measurements,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Moderate anti-exceptionalism and earthborn logic,"In this paper we put forward and defend a view of the nature of logic that we call moderate anti-exceptionalism. In the first part of the paper we focus on the problem of genuine logical validity and consequence. We make use of examples from current debates to show that attempts to pinpoint the one and only authentic logic inevitably either yield irrefutable (and hence methodologically idle) theories or lead to dead ends. We then outline a thoroughly naturalist account of logical consequence as grounded in rules implicit in human linguistic practices (and thus immune to Quinean criticism of basing logic on explicit conventions). We insist that there are only two existing kinds of language: natural languages, and artificial languages that have been forged by us. There is thus no room for a “genuine” language (independent of us) and hence for “genuine” logic. We conclude that though logical theories are established - and are liable to criticism - in a similar fashion as those of the sciences, and in this sense logic is not exceptional, to fulfill its mission logic must lay a claim to normative authority over our argumentation and reasoning, which makes its methodology somewhat special. Logical theory is not meant to provide just an explanation, the standards it establishes serve also as a tool, providing for a reinforcement of our rational communication.",60301.0,"Peregrin, Jaroslav:Svoboda, Vladimír",Synthese,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Persistent Effusions and Recurrent Hemarthrosis After Total Knee Arthroplasty,"A patient&apos,s expectation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a knee that is painless and fuctional in terms of movement, strength, and endurance without signs of inflammation. This section will focus predominantly on patients with an early chronic effusion of unknown etiology after TKA. A chronic effusion is defined as occurrence of a significant amount of joint fluid in the TKA after the first 3 months postoperatively. Conversely, s mall amount of joint fluid is a normal finding after TKA. Although no data are available, we propose that repeated aspirations for swelling of the TKA indicate that the TKA is not functioning normally and should be further investigated. For the diagnosis of simple recurrent effusion, the aspirated joint fluid should not be bloody (indicative of hemarthrosis). If the data including the appearance/content of joint fluid support the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI), the case is reclassified from chronic effusion to PJI.

Normative attitudes,"Brandom tells us how norms underlie our language and our social practices, and he explains norms as eventually hinging on the normative attitudes of individual participants of the practices. In recent decades interest in normativity has markedly increased not only in philosophy, but also within empirical science (both natural and social sciences), and this provokes the question: is the Brandomian account of norms compatible with what we know about these phenomena from empirical research, and can it be rendered in naturalistic terms? Brandom would disagree, because, according to him, genuine norms are constituted by only correct normative attitudes, which prevents us from reducing the normative to the natural.

Steepest Descent Method with Random Step Lengths,"The paper studies the steepest descent method applied to the minimization of a twice continuously differentiable function. Under certain conditions, the random choice of the step length parameter, independent of the actual iteration, generates a process that is almost surely R-convergent for quadratic functions. The convergence properties of this random procedure are characterized based on the mean value function related to the distribution of the step length parameter. The distribution of the random step length, which guarantees the maximum asymptotic convergence rate independent of the detailed properties of the Hessian matrix of the minimized function, is found, and its uniqueness is proved. The asymptotic convergence rate of this optimally created random procedure is equal to the convergence rate of the Chebyshev polynomials method. Under practical conditions, the efficiency of the suggested random steepest descent method is degraded by numeric noise, particularly for ill-conditioned problems, furthermore, the asymptotic convergence rate is not achieved due to the finiteness of the realized calculations. The suggested random procedure is also applied to the minimization of a general non-quadratic function. An algorithm needed to estimate relevant bounds for the Hessian matrix spectrum is created. In certain cases, the random procedure may surpass the conjugate gradient method. Interesting results are achieved when minimizing functions having a large number of local minima.

Advancing “ethnic unity” and “de-extremization”. Ideational governance in Xinjiang under “new circumstances” (2012-2017),"The central role of ideology has been one of the key features of the political system of the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 1949. One of the places where the phenomenon can be observed is the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, a vast, important, and rich borderland area inhabited by some 10 million Turkic Muslim Uyghurs. Since 1949, the central government has managed to win only a limited degree of Uyghur support for its policies, leaving the region riven with protest and violence. The central government has therefore sought to devise and implement policies so as to simultaneously address multiple aspects of Xinjiang's reality, including ideational affairs. This paper examines the party-state's ideational governance, i.e. efforts to define and regulate Uyghur values, beliefs, and loyalties so that they are instrumental in maintaining the political stability of the PRC. Firstly, the novel approach to Xinjiang policy adopted by the Xi leadership during its first functional term (2012-2017) is examined, namely its concern with Xinjiang's growing geopolitical significance and with the security dimension of the Xinjiang problem. Two main focuses of Xinjiang governance are introduced, particularly the advancement of centripetal inter-ethnic relations (officially called “ethnic unity”) and the eradication of religious or cultural practices deemed as potentially subversive (“de-extremization”). Secondly, the ideology relating to Xinjiang is examined within the framework of the CPC's national-level ideology. Thirdly, new legislation, by which the authorities seek to legitimate Xinjiang policies, is considered. Fourthly, several grassroots “ethnic unity” and “de-extremization” activities are reviewed as examples of the party-state's efforts to use the Uyghur religion and other intangible domains as ideational apparatuses to inculcate desirable political values. The conclusions reached in this article raise the broader question as to whether the party-state's resolve to strengthening its ideational governance over the Uyghurs will bring about a change in the security situation in Xinjiang.",50601.0,"Klimeš, Ondřej",Journal of Chinese Political Science,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On Feedback Architectures With Zero-Vibration Signal Shapers,"The classical and recent feedback solutions for signal shapers are reviewed and critically analyzed in this paper. Based on this assessment, a new effective feedback control architecture is proposed, suitable for manipulation of weakly damped flexible structures. More specifically, we propose to include the inverse of a signal shaper’s dynamics in the feedback path, and we justify this architecture by analysis of important feedback loop channels, namely the feedback responses from input disturbance to output and from reference to output. Both the classical ZV shaper with one lumped delay, and more recent shapers with distributed delays are considered and analyzed. The most appreciated features of suitable distributed-delay shapers are retarded characteristics—the closed-loop spectrum does not exhibit highfrequency roots close to the imaginary axis (in contrast to ZV shapers)—and at the same time reduced sensitivity of the closed loop interconnection to output disturbances.

"East meets West, West Meets East?

First, it is demonstrated that whereas Adalbert accepted the ideals set by the Carolingian clergy during the ninth century, thus focusing on pastoral practice and the salvation of his flock, Neilos preferred the life within the community of his peers and understood salvation more as an individual than as a political problem. Second, the role played by the Latin and Roman church in the life of St Neilos is analyzed.

Conformational rearrangement of the NMDA receptor amino-terminal domain during activation and allosteric modulation,"N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ionotropic glutamate receptors essential for synaptic plasticity and memory. Receptor activation involves glycine- and glutamate-stabilized closure of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunit ligand binding domains that is allosterically regulated by the amino-terminal domain (ATD). Using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to monitor subunit rearrangements in real-time, we observe a stable ATD inter-dimer distance in the Apo state and test the effects of agonists and antagonists. We find that GluN1 and GluN2 have distinct gating functions. Glutamate binding to GluN2 subunits elicits two identical, sequential steps of ATD dimer separation. Glycine binding to GluN1 has no detectable effect, but unlocks the receptor for activation so that glycine and glutamate together drive an altered activation trajectory that is consistent with ATD dimer separation and rotation. We find that protons exert allosteric inhibition by suppressing the glutamate-driven ATD separation steps, and that greater ATD separation translates into greater rotation and higher open probability. N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) activation involves closure of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunit ligand binding domains, which is regulated allosterically by the amino-terminal domain (ATD). Here, smFRET, used to monitor conformational rearrangements of the NMDAR ATD, reveals that glutamate binding to GluN2 subunits elicits two identical, sequential steps of ATD dimer separation that are regulated by protons.",30103.0,"Vyklický, Vojtěch:Stanley, Ch.:Habrian, Ch.:Isacoff, E.

"5-fluorouracil and other fluoropyrimidines in colorectal cancer: Past, present and future","5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an essential component of systemic chemotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) in the palliative and adjuvant settings. Over the past four decades, several modulation strategies including the implementation of 5-FU-based combination regimens and 5-FU pro-drugs have been developed and tested to increase the anti-tumor activity of 5-FU and to overcome the clinical resistance.  Despite the encouraging progress in CRC therapy to date, the patients response rates to therapy continue to remain low and the patients benefit from 5-FU-based therapy is frequently compromised by the development of chemoresistance. Inter-individual differences in the treatment response in CRC patients may originate in the unique genetic and epigenetic make-up of each individual.  The critical element in the current trend of personalized medicine is the proper comprehension of causes and mechanisms contributing to the low or lack of sensitivity of tumor tissue to 5-FU-based therapy. The identification and validation of predictive biomarkers for existing 5-FU-based and new targeted therapies for CRC treatment will likely improve patients' outcomes in the future.  Herein we present a comprehensive review summarizing options of CRC treatment and the mechanisms of 5-FU action at the molecular level, including both anabolic' and catabolic ways. The main part of this review comprises the currently known molecular mechanisms underlying the chemoresistance in CRC patients. We also focus on various 5-FU pro-drugs developed to increase the amount of circulating 5-FU and to limit toxicity.

"Synergy between NMR measurements and MD simulations of protein/RNA complexes: application to the RRMs, the most common RNA recognition motifs","RNA recognition motif (RRM) proteins represent an abundant class of proteins playing key roles in RNA biology. We present a joint atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) and experimental study of two RRM-containing proteins bound with their single-stranded target RNAs, namely the Fox-1 and SRSF1 complexes. The simulations are used in conjunction with NMR spectroscopy to interpret and expand the available structural data. We accumulate more than 50 mu s of simulations and show that the MD method is robust enough to reliably describe the structural dynamics of the RRM-RNA complexes. The simulations predict unanticipated specific participation of Arg142 at the protein-RNA interface of the SRFS1 complex, which is subsequently confirmed by NMR and ITC measurements. Several segments of the protein-RNA interface may involve competition between dynamical local substates rather than firmly formed interactions, which is indirectly consistent with the primary NMR data. We demonstrate that the simulations can be used to interpret the NMR atomistic models and can provide qualified predictions. Finally, we propose a protocol for 'MD-adapted structure ensemble' as a way to integrate the simulation predictions and expand upon the deposited NMR structures.

A careful reassessment of the reader marks and additions shows that these important witnesses to further use of the manuscript do not come from an inquisitorial milieu, as Borst and Thouzellier hypothesized for some of them, but mostly point to the milieu of the Cathar Church of Desenzano in the mid-thirteenth century.

Mirror Instability in the Turbulent Solar Wind,"The relationship between a decaying strong turbulence and the mirror instability in a slowly expanding plasma is investigated using two-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulations. We impose an initial ambient magnetic field perpendicular to the simulation box, and we start with a spectrum of large-scale, linearly polarized, random-phase Alfvénic fluctuations that have energy equipartition between kinetic and magnetic fluctuations and a vanishing correlation between the two fields. A turbulent cascade rapidly develops, magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum at large scales and a steeper spectrum at sub-ion scales. The imposed expansion (taking a strictly transverse ambient magnetic field) leads to the generation of an important perpendicular proton temperature anisotropy that eventually drives the mirror instability. This instability generates large-amplitude, nonpropagating, compressible, pressure-balanced magnetic structures in a form of magnetic enhancements/humps that reduce the perpendicular temperature anisotropy.",10305.0,"Hellinger, Petr:Landi, S.:Matteini, L.:Verdini, A.:Franci, L.",Astrophysical Journal,2,high,high,0,0,medium,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Actions Speak Louder Than Words? The Untapped Potential of V4 Parliaments in EU Affairs,"This article offers the first ever comparative analysis of the involvement of V4 parliaments in the sphere of European Union (EU) affairs. Its underlying research objective is to determine what conditions V4&apos,s parliamentary participation in various EU-oriented activities such as domestic scrutiny of the government&apos,s EU policy, the political dialogue with the Commission, the Early Warning System for subsidiarity control, and the green card initiative. Based on the actual scrutiny output, parliamentary minutes, and data from questionnaires, we address the questions: (1) To what extent domestic legislatures act as autonomous as opposed to government-supporting actors in these arenas? (2) Do they mostly act as EU veto players, or try to contribute constructively to the EU policy-making process by bringing alternative policy ideas? (3) What are their motivations for engaging in direct dialogue with EU institutions in addition to domestic scrutiny? and (4) How MPs envisage their own EU-oriented roles? While the article reveals that V4 parliaments mostly act as gatekeepers in the sphere of EU affairs, it also casts a new light on the previous literature findings related to the EU-oriented performance of the Czech and Polish lower chambers.

FoxO1-GAB1 axis regulates homing capacity and tonic AKT activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"Recirculation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells between the peripheral blood and lymphoid niches plays a critical role in disease pathophysiology, and inhibiting this process is one of the major mechanisms of action for B-cell receptor (BCR) inhibitors such as ibrutinib and idelalisib. Migration is a complex process guided by chemokine receptors and integrins. However, it remains largely unknown how CLL cells integrate multiple migratory signals while balancing survival in the peripheral blood and the decision to return to immune niches. Our study provided evidence that CXCR4/CD5 intraclonal subpopulations can be used to study the regulation of migration of CLL cells. We performed RNA profiling of CXCR4(dim)CD5(bright) vs CXCR4(bright) CD5(dim) CLL cells and identified differential expression of dozens of molecules with a putative function in cell migration. GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1) positively regulated CLL cell homing capacity of CXCR4(bright)DD5(dim) cells. Gradual GAB1 accumulation in CLL cells outside immune niches was mediated by FoxO1-induced transcriptional GAB1 activation. Upregulation of GAB1 also played an important role in maintaining basal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13K) activity and the ""tonic"" AKT phosphorylation required to sustain the survival of resting CLL B cells. This finding is important during ibrutinib therapy, because CLL cells induce the FoxO1-GAB1-pAKT axis, which represents an adaptation mechanism to the inability to home to immune niches. We have demonstrated that GAB1 can be targeted therapeutically by novel GAB1 inhibitors, alone or in combination with BTK inhibition. GAB1 inhibitors induce CLL cell apoptosis, impair cell migration, inhibit tonic or BCR-induced AKT phosphorylation, and block compensatory AKT activity during ibrutinib therapy.",30205.0,"Šeda, Václav:Vojáčková, Eva:Ondrišová, Laura:Košťálová, Lenka:Sharma, Sonali:Loja, Tomáš:Mladonická Pavlasová, Gabriela:Zicha, Daniel:Kudličková Pešková, Marie:Křivánek, Jan:Matulová, Květoslava:Křen, Leoš:Benes, V.:Litzmanová, Markéta:Borský, Marek:Oppelt, Jan:Verner, Jan:Pospíšilová, Šárka:Brychtová, Yvona:Panovská, Anna:Tan, Z.:Zhang, S.X.:Doubek, Michael:Amruz Černá, Kateřina:Mayer, Jiří:Mráz, Marek",Blood,2,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Noninvasive Immunohistochemical Diagnosis and Novel MUC1 Mutations Causing Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease,"Background: Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease caused by mucin-1 gene (MUC1) mutations (ADTKD-MUC1) is characterized by progressive kidney failure. Genetic evaluation for ADTKD-MUC1 specifically tests for a cytosine duplication that creates a unique frameshift protein (MUC1fs). Our goal was to develop immunohistochemical methods to detect the MUC1fs created by the cytosine duplication and, possibly, by other similar frameshift mutations and to identify novel MUC1 mutations in individuals with positive immunohistochemical staining for the MUC1fs protein. Methods: We performed MUC1fs immunostaining on urinary cell smears and various tissues from ADTKD-MUC1-positive and -negative controls as well as in individuals from 37 ADTKD families that were negative for mutations in known ADTKD genes. We used novel analytic methods to identify MUC1 frameshift mutations. Results: After technique refinement, the sensitivity and specificity for MUC1fs immunostaining of urinary cell smears were 94.2% and 88.6%, respectively. Further genetic testing on 17 families with positive MUC1fs immunostaining revealed six families with five novel MUC1 frameshift mutations that all predict production of the identical MUC1fs protein. Conclusions: We developed a noninvasive immunohistochemical method to detect MUC1fs that, after further validation, may be useful in the future for diagnostic testing. Production of the MUC1fs protein may be central to the pathogenesis of ADTKD-MUC1.",30217.0,"Živná, Martina:Kidd, Kendrah:Přistoupilová, Anna:Barešová, Veronika:DeFelice, Mathew:Blumenstiel, Brendan:Harden, Maegan:Conlon, Peter:Lavin, Peter:Connaughton, Dervla M.:Hartmannová, Hana:Hodaňová, Kateřina:Stránecký, Viktor:Vrbacká, Alena:Vyleťal, Petr:Živný, Jan:Votruba, Miroslav:Sovová, Jana:Hůlková, Helena:Robins, Victoria:Perry, Rebecca:Wenzel, Andrea:Beck, Bodo B.:Seeman, Tomáš:Viklický, Ondřej:Rajnochová-Bloudíčková, Sylvie:Papagregoriou, Gregory:Deltas, Constantinos C.:Alper, Seth L.:Greka, Anna:Bleyer, Anthony:Kmoch, Stanislav",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The redclaw crayfish: A prominent aquaculture species with invasive potential in tropical and subtropical biodiversity hotspots,"The redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus, hereafter redclaw), native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea, is among the largest freshwater decapods. It matures early and is considered highly prolific as females may lay over one thousand eggs in a single clutch. Despite generally preferring slow-moving streams in its native range, it has a wide environmental tolerance, making it capable of establishing populations when introduced to a wide range of other conditions and habitats. These biological and ecological features render it a highly suitable and popular species for aquaculture worldwide, being the second most important crayfish species economically (after the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii). Adding to that, its unique coloration fuels demand and value among aquarium enthusiasts, making it attractive for the aquarium pet trade. Today, redclaw is widely translocated (67 countries/territories) and various established wild populations (22 countries) have been reported on every continent except Antarctica. Information on its potential or observed impacts, however, is sparse and often anecdotal. To address this gap, this comprehensive review compiles all available information on this species, covering its taxonomy and description, biology and ecology, native and non-native ranges accompanied with documented introduction pathways. Built upon these, we conducted biological and socio-economic classification and species distribution modelling. We reveal a lack of thorough impact assessments for this species despite sufficient indications of major observable impacts at local scales. We call attention to the importance of managing the use of this prominent introduced species in aquaculture and aquarium pet trade.",40103.0,"Haubrock, Phillip Joschka:Oficialdegui, Francisco J:Zeng, Yiwen:Patoka, Jiri:Yeo, Darren C.

Evaluation of the medical devices benchmark materials in the controlled human patch testing and in the RhE in vitro skin irritation protocol,"Several irritants were used in the in vitro irritation medical device round robin. The objective of this study was to verify their irritation potential using the human patch test (HPT), an in vitro assay, and in vivo data. The irritants were lactic acid (LA), heptanoic acid (HA), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Genapol (R) X-80 (GP), and Y-4 polymer. Dilute saline and sesame seed oil (SSO) solutions of each were evaluated using a 4 and 18 h HPT and the EpiDerm (TM) SIT-MD RhE assay, results were then compared to existing rabbit skin irritation test data. Results from the 4 h HPT were negative in most cases except for GP and SDS, while the 18 h HPT also identified some LA, HA, and GP samples as irritants. EpiDerm (TM) SIT-MD correctly identified all irritants except GP in SSO due to limited solubility. Data from cutaneous rabbit irritation tests were negative, while all intracutaneous results were strongly or weakly positive except for the most dilute GP solutions. These findings indicate that EpiDerm (TM) SIT MD results correlate with those from the rabbit intracutaneous test and confirm that RhE assays are suitable replacements for animals in evaluating the tissue irritation potential of medical devices.",30108.0,"Kandárová, H.:Bendová, Hana:Latasiova, S.:Coleman, K.P.:De Jong, W.H.:Jírová, Dagmar",Toxicology in Vitro,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Excited-state quantum phase transitions in systems with two degrees of freedom. III. Interacting boson systems,"The series of articles [Ann. Phys. 345, 73 (2014) and 356, 57 (2015)] devoted to excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) in systems with f = 2 degrees of freedom is continued by studying the interacting boson model of nuclear collective dynamics as an example of a truly many-body system. The intrinsic Hamiltonian formalism with angular momentum fixed to L = 0 is used to produce a generic first-order ground-state quantum phase transition with an adjustable energy barrier between the competing equilibrium configurations. The associated ESQPTs are shown to result from various classical stationary points of the model Hamiltonian, whose analysis is more complex than in previous cases because of (i) a nontrivial decomposition to kinetic and potential energy terms and (ii) the boundedness of the associated classical phase space. Finite-size effects resulting from a partial separability of both degrees of freedom are analyzed.

Probabilistic crack bridge model reflecting random bond properties and elastic matrix deformation,"A semi-analytical probabilistic model of an isolated composite crack bridge is presented in this paper. With the assumptions of heterogeneous fibrous reinforcement embedded in an elastic matrix the model is capable of evaluating the stress and strain fields in both fibers and matrix. In order to be applicable as a representative unit in models at higher scales, the micromechanical response of the composite crack bridge is homogenized by using a probabilistic approach. Specifically, the mean response of a crack bridge is obtained as the integral of the response of a single fiber over the domain of random variables weighted by their joint probability density function. This approach has been used by the authors in a recent publication describing a single crack bridge with rigid matrix. The main extension of the present crack bridge model is the incorporation of elastic matrix deformations and of boundary conditions restricting fiber debonding at the crack bridge boundaries. The latter extension is needed to reflect the effects of interactions with neighboring cracks within a tensile specimen with multiple cracks. The model is verified against three limiting cases with known analytical solutions (fiber bundle model, crack bridge with rigid matrix, mono-filament in elastic matrix) and is shown to be in exact conformity with all of these limiting cases.",20102.0,"Vořechovský, Miroslav:Rypl, Rostislav:Chudoba, Rostislav",COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING,2,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Splash erosion affected by initial soil moisture and surface conditions under simulated rainfall,"Soil erosion by water is one of the most severe soil degradation processes. Splash erosion is the initial stage of soil erosion by water, resulting from the destructive force of rain drops acting on soil surface aggregates. Apart from rainfall properties, constant soil physical properties (texture and soil organic matter) are crucial in understanding the splash erosion. However, there is lack of information about the effect of variable soil properties such as soil initial water content and surface condition (seal formation) on splash erosion. The objective of the present study was to determine how initial water content and surface condition affected soil splash erosion under simulated rainfall. The changes in soil surface condition were characterized by hydraulic variability (saturated hydraulic conductivity) due to surface seal formation. Slit loam and loamy sand soil textures were used in the experiment. Rainfall was created in the laboratory using two types of rainfall simulators covering intensity range from 28 to 54 mm h-1 and from 35 to 81 mm h-1. The soil samples were exposed to three consecutive rainfall simulations with different time intervals between simulations and different initial water content and surface conditions (air-dried, wet-sealed, and dry-crusted). Wet-sealed soil samples had up to 70% lower splash erosion rate compared to air-dried samples, due to surface ponding followed by seal formation. A significant decrease in soil saturated hydraulic conductivity indicated the formation of surface seal for silt loam soils. A non-significant decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity for loamy sand soil was attributed to earlier formation of stable seals. These results provide insight into dynamic changes of individual soil parameters affected by rainfall, and could find wider application for more complex soil erosion prediction models.",40104.0,"Zambon, N.:Johannsen, L.:Strauss, P.:Dostál, Tomáš:Zumr, David:Cochrane, T.:Klik, A.",CATENA,2,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

METHODS: In a randomized, controlled trial, we assigned a subgroup of patients who were undergoing TAVI and did not have an indication for long-term anticoagulation, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive aspirin alone or aspirin plus clopidogrel for 3 months. The two primary outcomes were all bleeding (including minor, major, and life-threatening or disabling bleeding) and non-procedure-related bleeding over a period of 12 months. Most bleeding at the TAVI puncture site was counted as non-procedure-related. The two secondary outcomes were a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, non-procedure-related bleeding, stroke, or myocardial infarction (secondary composite 1) and a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction (secondary composite 2) at 1 year, with both outcomes tested sequentially for noninferiority (noninferiority margin, 7.5 percentage points) and superiority. RESULTS: A total of 331 patients were assigned to receive aspirin alone and 334 were assigned to receive aspirin plus clopidogrel. A bleeding event occurred in 50 patients (15.1%) receiving aspirin alone and in 89 (26.6%) receiving aspirin plus clopidogrel (risk ratio, 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.77, P = 0.001).

Reactive adsorption and photodegradation of soman and dimethyl methylphosphonate on TiO2/nanodiamond composites,"We report on the synthesis and characterization of TiO2/Nanodiamond (ND) nanocomposites for rapid decontamination of chemical warfare agents (CWA) and toxic industrial compounds prepared by a simple water-based, low-temperature method using urea as a homogeneous precipitating agent. The excellent water-compatibility of NDs promoted their good dispersion within the TiO2 matrix resulting in intergrown TiO2/ND nanostructures. NDs with an abundance of oxygen-containing surface moieties increased the porosity of the composites resulting in their three times more efficient spontaneous degradation of the CWA soman in solution compared to pure TiO2. In situ DRIFT spectroscopy revealed the enhanced reactive adsorption and solar light photodecomposition of dimethyl methyl phosphonate vapor on TiO2/ND. The charge transfer across TiO2/ND interfaces that hinder recombination of photo-excited electron-hole pairs was inferred from surface potential measurements. The results indicate that well-dispersed NDs forming heterojunctions together with their high porosity contribute to the reactive properties of the nanocomposites.",21001.0,"Henych, Jiří:Stehlík, Štěpán:Mazanec, Karel:Tolasz, Jakub:Čermák, Jan:Rezek, Bohuslav:Mattson, Andreas:Osterlund, Lars",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Conventional-flow liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for exploratory bottom-up proteomic analyses,"Due to its sensitivity and productivity, bottom-up proteomics based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become the core approach in the field. The de facto standard LC-MS platform for proteomics operates at sub-mu L/min flow rates, and nanospray is required for efficiently introducing peptides into a mass spectrometer. Although this is almost a &quot,dogma&quot,, this view is being reconsidered in light of developments in highly efficient chromatographic columns, and especially with the introduction of exceptionally sensitive MS instruments. Although conventional-flow LC-MS platforms have recently penetrated targeted proteomics successfully, their possibilities in discovery-oriented proteomics have not yet been thoroughly explored. Our objective was to determine what are the extra costs and what optimization and adjustments to a conventional-flow LC-MS system must be undertaken to identify a comparable number of proteins as can be identified on a nanoLC-MS system. We demonstrate that the amount of a complex tryptic digest needed for comparable proteome coverage can be roughly 5-fold greater, providing the column dimensions are properly chosen, extra-column peak dispersion is minimized, column temperature and flow rate are set to levels appropriate for peptide separation, and the composition of mobile phases is fine-tuned. Indeed, we identified 2 835 proteins from 2 mu g of HeLa cells tryptic digest separated during a 60 min gradient at 68 mu L/min on a 1.0 mm x 250 mm column held at 55 degrees C and using an aqua-acetonitrile mobile phases containing 0.1% formic acid, 0.4% acetic acid, and 3% dimethyl sulfoxide.

Self-adapting self-organizing migrating algorithm,"The self-organizing migrating algorithm is a population-based algorithm belonging to swarm intelligence, which has been successfully applied in several areas for solving non-trivial optimization problems. However, based on our experiments, the original formulation of this algorithm suffers with some shortcomings as loss of population diversity, premature convergence, and the necessity of the control parameters hand-tuning. The main contribution of this paper is the development of the novel algorithm mitigating the mentioned issues of the original self-organizing migrating algorithm. We have applied the ideas of the self-adaptation of the control parameters, the different principle of the leader creation, and the external archive of the successful particles. For some special cases, we are able to utilize the differential grouping to detect the interacting variables effectively removing the need for the perturbation parameter. To prove the efficiency of the novel algorithm, we have performed experiments on fifteen unconstrained problems from the CEC 2015 benchmark. The algorithm is compared with seven well-known evolutionary and swarm algorithms. The results of the experiments indicate that the mechanisms used in the novel algorithm had significantly improved the performance of the original self-organizing migrating algorithm, and the new algorithm can now compete with the selected algorithms.",10201.0,"Skanderová, Lenka:Fabián, Tomáš:Zelinka, Ivan",Swarm and Evolutionary Computation,2,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Volatile anesthetics versus total intravenous anesthesia for cardiac surgery,"BACKGROUND Volatile (inhaled) anesthetic agents have cardioprotective effects, which might improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS We conducted a pragmatic, multicenter, single-blind, controlled trial at 36 centers in 13 countries. Patients scheduled to undergo elective CABG were randomly assigned to an intraoperative anesthetic regimen that included a volatile anesthetic (desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane) or to total intravenous anesthesia. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 1 year. RESULTS A total of 5400 patients were randomly assigned: 2709 to the volatile anesthetics group and 2691 to the total intravenous anesthesia group. On-pump CABG was performed in 64% of patients, with a mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass of 79 minutes. The two groups were similar with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, and the number of grafts. At the time of the second interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board advised that the trial should be stopped for futility. No significant difference between the groups with respect to deaths from any cause was seen at 1 year (2.8% in the volatile anesthetics group and 3.0% in the total intravenous anesthesia group, relative risk, 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 1.29, P=0.71), with data available for 5353 patients (99.1%), or at 30 days (1.4% and 1.3%, respectively, relative risk, 1.11, 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.76), with data available for 5398 patients (99.9%). There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the secondary outcomes or in the incidence of prespecified adverse events, including myocardial infarction.

Viral discovery and diversity in trypanosomatid protozoa with a focus on relatives of the human parasite Leishmania,"Knowledge of viral diversity is expanding greatly, but many lineages remain underexplored. We surveyed RNA viruses in 52 cultured monoxenous relatives of the human parasite Leishmania (Crithidia and Leptomonas), as well as plant-infecting Phytomonas. Leptomonas pyrrhocoris was a hotbed for viral discovery, carrying a virus (Leptomonas pyrrhocoris ostravirus 1) with a highly divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase missed by conventional BLAST searches, an emergent clade of tombus-like viruses, and an example of viral endogenization. A deep-branching clade of trypanosomatid narnaviruses was found, notable as Leptomonas seymouri bearing Narna-like virus 1 (LepseyNLV1) have been reported in cultures recovered from patients with visceral leishmaniasis. A deep-branching trypanosomatid viral lineage showing strong affinities to bunyaviruses was termed ""Leishbunyavirus"" (LBV) and judged sufficiently distinct to warrant assignment within a proposed family termed ""Leishbunyaviridae."" Numerous relatives of trypanosomatid viruses were found in insect metatranscriptomic surveys, which likely arise from trypanosomatid microbiota. Despite extensive sampling we found no relatives of the totivirus Leishmaniavirus (LRV1/2), implying that it was acquired at about the same time the Leishmania became able to parasitize vertebrates. As viruses were found in over a quarter of isolates tested, many more are likely to be found in the >600 unsurveyed trypanosomatid species. Viral loss was occasionally observed in culture, providing potentially isogenic virus-free lines enabling studies probing the biological role of trypanosomatid viruses. These data shed important insights on the emergence of viruses within an important trypanosomatid clade relevant to human disease.",10600.0,"Grybchuk, Danyil:Akopyants, N.

Analyte transport to micro- and nano-plasmonic structures,"The study of optical affinity biosensors based on plasmonic nanostructures has received significant attention in recent years. The sensing surfaces of these biosensors have complex architectures, often composed of localized regions of high sensitivity (electromagnetic hot spots) dispersed along a dielectric substrate having little to no sensitivity. Under conditions such that the sensitive regions are selectively functionalized and the remaining regions passivated, the rate of analyte capture (and thus the sensing performance) will have a strong dependence on the nanoplasmonic architecture. Outside of a few recent studies, there has been little discussion on how changes to a nanoplasmonic architecture will affect the rate of analyte transport. We recently proposed an analytical model to predict transport to such complex architectures, however, those results were based on numerical simulation and to date, have only been partially verified. In this study we measure the characteristics of analyte transport across a wide range of plasmonic structures, varying both in the composition of their base plasmonic element (microwires, nanodisks, and nanorods) and the packing density of such elements. We functionalized each structure with nucleic acid-based bioreceptors, where for each structure we used analyte/receptor sequences as to maintain a Damkohler number close to unity. This method allows to extract both kinetic (in the form of association and dissociation constants) and analyte transport parameters (in the form of a mass transfer coefficient) from sensorgrams taken from each substrate. We show that, despite having large differences in optical characteristics, measured rates of analyte transport for all plasmonic structures match very well to predictions using our previously proposed model. These results highlight that, along with optical characteristics, analyte transport plays a large role in the overall sensing performance of a nanoplasmonic biosensor.",10406.0,"Lynn, Nicholas Scott:Špringer, Tomáš:Slabý, Jiří:Špačková, Barbora:Gráfová, Michaela:Ermini, Maria Laura:Homola, Jiří",Lab on a Chip,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Anthropogenic global shifts in biospheric N and P concentrations and ratios and their impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem productivity, food security, and human health","The availability of carbon (C) from high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and anthropogenic release of nitrogen (N) is increasing, but these increases are not paralleled by increases in levels of phosphorus (P). The current unstoppable changes in the stoichiometries of C and N relative to P have no historical precedent. We describe changes in P and N fluxes over the last five decades that have led to asymmetrical increases in P and N inputs to the biosphere. We identified widespread and rapid changes in N:P ratios in air, soil, water, and organisms and important consequences to the structure, function, and biodiversity of ecosystems. A mass-balance approach found that the combined limited availability of P and N was likely to reduce C storage by natural ecosystems during the remainder of the 21st Century, and projected crop yields of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment indicated an increase in nutrient deficiency in developing regions if access to P fertilizer is limited. Imbalances of the N:P ratio would likely negatively affect human health, food security, and global economic and geopolitical stability, with feedbacks and synergistic effects on drivers of global environmental change, such as increasing levels of CO2, climatic warming, and increasing pollution. We summarize potential solutions for avoiding the negative impacts of global imbalances of N:P ratios on the environment, biodiversity, climate change, food security, and human health.",10619.0,"Penuelas, Josep:Janssens, I.

Inference for cluster point processes with over- or under-dispersed cluster sizes,"Cluster point processes comprise a class of models that have been used for a wide range of applications. While several models have been studied for the probability density function of the offspring displacements and the parent point process, there are few examples of non-Poisson distributed cluster sizes. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of the Thomas process, which allows for the cluster sizes to have a variance that is greater or less than the expected value. We refer to this as the cluster sizes being over- and under-dispersed, respectively. To fit the model, we introduce minimum contrast methods and a Bayesian MCMC algorithm. These are evaluated in a simulation study. It is found that using the Bayesian MCMC method, we are in most cases able to detect over- and under-dispersion in the cluster sizes. We use the MCMC method to fit the model to nerve fiber data, and contrast the results to those of a fitted Thomas process",10103.0,"Andersson, Claes:Mrkvička, Tomáš",Statistics and Computing,2,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Quantitative Study of Straw Bio-oil Hydrodeoxygenation over a Sulfided NiMo Catalyst""","Bio-oil upgrading through its hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) using sulfided catalysts has attracted significant attention due to its potential to provide advanced biofuels. Although many studies have been undertaken, a detailed understanding of the changes in the chemical composition on the molecular level that would allow the better design of catalysts for bio-oil upgrading is still insufficient. Therefore, we have subjected straw bio-oil and products obtained from its hydrotreatment over a broad range of experimental conditions to a detailed quantitative chemical analysis. Most of the volatile compounds were quantified by GC-MS. Among them, 115 compounds were quantified directly (i.e., using the appropriate standards) and more than 100 indirectly (i.e., based on their structural similarity with corresponding standards). Moreover, the total concentrations of carboxylic acids, carbonyls and phenols were quantified by the Carboxylic Acid Number (CAN), Faix, and Folin-Ciocalteu methods, respectively, to obtain complementary and/or supporting information on the chemical composition to the GC-MS data. The detailed quantification of most volatile compounds in the feed and the products allowed us to create a reactivity order of the oxygen-containing functional groups present and to understand the origin of some of the compounds. Based on the results, the upgrading of straw bio-oil from ablative fast pyrolysis at 340°C and 4 MPa seems to be optimal when evaluating the severity of the reaction conditions and hydrogen consumption, on the one hand, and the products quality, on the other hand. This provides a good starting point for further catalyst development and optimization allowing for the long-term upgrading of the bio-oil for obtaining petroleum-refinery-compatible feedstock.",10406.0,"Auersvald, Miloš:Shumeiko, Bogdan:Staš, Martin:Kubička, David:Chudoba, Josef:Šimáček, Pavel","ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp, Engineering",2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

To devise new strategies to combat chronic B. cenocepacia infections, it is essential to obtain comprehensive knowledge about their pathogenesis. We conducted a comparative genomic analysis of 32 Czech isolates of epidemic clone B. cenocepacia ST32 isolated from various stages of chronic infection in 8 CF patients. High numbers of large-scale deletions were found to occur during chronic infection, affecting preferentially genomic islands and nonessential replicons. Recombination between insertion sequences (IS) was inferred as the mechanism behind deletion formation, the most numerous IS group was specific for the ST32 clone and has undergone transposition burst since its divergence. Genes functionally related to transition metal metabolism were identified as hotspots for deletions and IS insertions. This functional category was also represented among genes where nonsynonymous point mutations and indels occurred parallelly among patients. Another category exhibiting parallel mutations was oxidative stress protection, mutations in catalase KatG resulted in impaired detoxification of hydrogen peroxide. Deep sequencing revealed substantial polymorphism in genes of both categories within the sputum B. cenocepacia ST32 populations, indicating extensive adaptive evolution. Neither oxidative stress response nor transition metal metabolism genes were previously reported to undergo parallel evolution during chronic CF infection. Mutations in katG and copper metabolism genes were overrepresented in patients where chronic infection developed into CS. Among professional phagocytes, macrophages use both hydrogen peroxide and copper for their bactericidal activity, our results thus tentatively point to macrophages as suspects in pathogenesis towards the fatal CS.",30203.0,"Nunvář, Jaroslav:Čapek, Václav:Fišer, Karel:Fila, Libor:Dřevínek, Pavel",PLoS Pathogens,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Embraced by eIF3: structural and functional insights into the roles of eIF3 across the translation cycle,"Protein synthesis is mediated via numerous molecules including the ribosome, mRNA, tRNAs, as well as translation initiation, elongation and release factors. Some of these factors play several roles throughout the entire process to ensure proper assembly of the preinitiation complex on the right mRNA, accurate selection of the initiation codon, errorless production of the encoded polypeptide and its proper termination. Perhaps, the most intriguing of these multitasking factors is the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3. Recent evidence strongly suggests that this factor, which coordinates the progress of most of the initiation steps, does not come off the initiation complex upon subunit joining, but instead it remains bound to 80S ribosomes and gradually falls off during the first few elongation cycles to: (1) promote resumption of scanning on the same mRNA molecule for reinitiation downstream-in case of translation of upstream ORFs short enough to preserve eIF3 bound, or (2) come back during termination on long ORFs to fine tune its fidelity or, if signaled, promote programmed stop codon readthrough. Here, we unite recent structural views of the eIF3-40S complex and discus all known eIF3 roles to provide a broad picture of the eIF3' s impact on translational control in eukaryotic cells.",10606.0,"Valášek, Leoš:Zeman, Jakub:Wagner, Susan:Beznosková, Petra:Pavlíková, Zuzana:Mohammad, Mahabub Pasha:Hronová, Vladislava:Herrmannová, Anna:Hashem, Y.:Gunišová, Stanislava",Nucleic Acids Research,2,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Urbanization of Nature in a (Post)Socialist Metropolis: An Urban Political Ecology of Allotment Gardening,"In this article we explore how nature becomes part of the city through the example of allotment gardening in the city of Prague, in the Czech Republic. Prague allotments were established based on an ongoing political‐ecological process of urbanization of nature that was locally driven by socialist (from 1948 to 1989) and later neoliberal governance. We employ a situated urban political ecology (UPE) approach to analyse changes in the planning of allotments and the impact thereof on the experience of gardeners. This double focus allows us to uncover the effects of neoliberalization on the processes of production of urban nature in respect of both policy and everyday practice. We contrast contemporary capitalist urbanization with its socialist predecessor by showing the immediate effects of the acceptance of neoliberal modes of governance on allotments, urban nature and the understanding of the city. We open allotments as a terrain for UPE to turn attention to the (uneven) production of urban nature in a post‐socialist context that has thus far been largely absent from the UPE literature. We demonstrate that post‐socialist urbanization is a fruitful terrain that offers new opportunities to unmask the effects of neoliberalization on the production of uneven urban space and thus improves our understanding of contemporary uneven urbanisms.",50401.0,"Gibas, Petr:Boumová, Irena",International Journal of Urban and Regional Research,2,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Highly-conducting molecular circuits based on antiaromaticity,"Aromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry. It is described by Huckel's rule that states that a cyclic planar pi-system is aromatic when it shares 4n+2 pi-electrons and antiaromatic when it possesses 4n pi-electrons. Antiaromatic compounds are predicted to exhibit remarkable charge transport properties and high redox activities. However, it has so far only been possible to measure compounds with reduced aromaticity but not antiaromatic species due to their energetic instability. Here, we address these issues by investigating the single-molecule charge transport properties of a genuinely antiaromatic compound, showing that antiaromaticity results in an order of magnitude increase in conductance compared with the aromatic counterpart. Single-molecule current-voltage measurements and ab initio transport calculations reveal that this results from a reduced energy gap and a frontier molecular resonance closer to the Fermi level in the antiaromatic species.",10302.0,"Fujii, S.:Marques-Gonzalez, S.:Shin, J.-Y.:Shinokubo, H.:Masuda, T.:Nishino, T.:Arasu, Narendra P.:Vázquez, Héctor:Kiguchi, M.",Nature Communications,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Genetic and aquaculture performance differentiation among wild allopatric populations of European perch (Percidae, Perca fluviatilis)","Present research suggests that phenotypic variations and consequent potential differences in suitability for commercial culture are more likely to occur among genetically diverse populations. We investigated diversity in traits important to aquaculture and assessed genetic differentiation based on four mitochondrial markers in three European populations of Perca fluviatilis. Using a transplant approach to standardize conditions and minimize environmental effects on phenotype expression, we compared survival, cannibalism, growth rate, growth heterogeneity, and specific growth rate of the populations to assess whether difference in aquaculture performance (i.e. expression of phenotypical traits that facilitate the rearing of fish and impact the productivity of the farming) is more likely between genetically differentiated populations than between genetically similar populations. We found key traits of performance to differ among allopatric populations, suggesting value in considering geographic source of broodstock. The largest aquaculture performance disparities were observed among genetically differentiated populations. Some lesser differences were observed between allopatric genetically similar populations, possibly the consequence of pre-collection environment, or transgenerational effects.",40103.0,"Vanina, Tatyana:Gebauer, Radek:Toomey, L.:Stejskal, Vlastimil:Rutegwa, Marcellin:Kouřil, Jan:Bláha, Martin:Lecocq, T.",Aquaculture,2,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Does intimacy counteract or amplify the detrimental effects of negative intergroup contact on attitudes?,"Past research is limited by a focus on intimacy in positive intergroup contact. This study tested whether intergroup intimacy counteracts or amplifies the detrimental effects of negative intergroup contact on outgroup attitudes. Participants from five Central European countries (N = 1,276) described their intergroup contact with, and attitudes towards, citizens from neighboring nations. We coded the contact descriptions for presence (vs. absence) of intimacy (intimate, casual, or formal relationships) and contact valence (negative, positive, or ambivalent). The results indicated that those who reported negative contact in the context of intimate relationships displayed more positive outgroup attitudes than those who reported negative contact in the context of nonintimate relationships. This protective function of intimacy extended to instances of ambivalent contact. Our findings speak of the additive value of intimacy and positivity for intergroup relations, they underscore the benefits of intimacy as part of not only positive but also negative intergroup contact.",50101.0,"Graf, Sylvie:Paolini, S.:Rubin, M.",Group Processes & Intergroup Relations,2,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
miR-29 Modulates CD40 Signaling in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia by Targeting TRAF4: an Axis Affected by BCR inhibitors,"B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and T cell interactions play a pivotal role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) pathogenesis and disease aggressiveness. CLL cells can utilize microRNAs (miRNAs) and their targets to modulate microenvironmental interactions in the lymph node niches. To identify miRNA expression changes in the CLL microenvironment, we performed complex profiling of short non-coding RNAs in this context by comparing CXCR4/CD5 intraclonal cell subpopulations (CXCR4dimCD5bright vs. CXCR4brightCD5dim cells). This identified dozens of differentially expressed miRNAs including several that have previously been shown to modulate BCR signaling (miR-155, miR-150, and miR-22), but also other candidates for a role in microenvironmental interactions. Notably, all three miR-29 family members (miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-29c) were consistently down-modulated in the immune niches, and lower miR-29(a/b/c) levels associated with an increased relative responsiveness of CLL cells to BCR ligation, and significantly shorter overall survival of CLL patients. We identified Tumor-Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 4 (TRAF4) as a novel direct target of miR-29s and revealed that higher TRAF4 levels increase CLL responsiveness to CD40 activation and downstream NFkB signaling. In CLL, BCR-represses miR-29 expression via MYC, allowing for concurrent TRAF4 upregulation and stronger CD40-NFkB signaling. This regulatory loop is disrupted by ""BCR inhibitors"" (BTK inhibitor ibrutinib or PI3K inhibitor idelalisib). In summary, we showed for the first time that a miRNA-dependent mechanism acts to activate CD40 signaling/T-cell interactions in a CLL microenvironment and described a novel miR-29-TRAF4-CD40 signaling axis modulated by the BCR activity.",30204.0,"Sharma, Sonali:Mladonická Pavlasová, Gabriela:Šeda, Václav:Amruz Černá, Kateřina:Vojáčková, Eva:Filip, Daniel:Ondrišová, Laura:Šandová, Veronika:Košťálová, Lenka:Faria Zeni, Pedro:Borský, Marek:Oppelt, Jan:Lišková, Květoslava:Křen, Leoš:Janíková, Andrea:Pospíšilová, Šárka:Fernandes, Stacey M.:Shehata, Medhat:Rassenti, Laura Z.:Jaeger, Ulrich:Doubek, Michael:Davids, Matthew S.:Brown, Jennifer R.:Mayer, Jiří:Kipps, Thomas J.:Mráz, Marek",Blood,2,high,high,0,1,high,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

High-Performance Supercapacitors Based on a Zwitterionic Network of Covalently Functionalized Graphene with Iron Tetraaminophthalocyanine,"Graphene derivatives are promising candidates as electrode materials in supercapacitor cells, therefore, functionalization strategies are pursued to improve their performance. A scalable approach is reported for preparing a covalently and homogenously functionalized graphene with iron tetraaminophthalocyanine (FePc-NH2) with a high degree of functionalization. This is achieved by exploiting fluorographene&apos,s reactivity with the diethyl bromomalonate, producing graphene-dicarboxylic acid after hydrolysis, which is conjugated with FePc-NH2. The material exhibits an ultrahigh gravimetric specific capacitance of 960 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and zero losses upon charging-discharging cycling. The energy density of 59 Wh kg(-1) is eminent among supercapacitors operating in aqueous electrolytes with graphene-based electrode materials. This is attributed to the structural and functional synergy of the covalently bound components, giving rise to a zwitterionic surface with extensive - stacking, but not graphene restacking, all being very beneficial for charge and ionic transport. The safety of the proposed system, owing to the benign Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, the high capacitance, energy density, and potential of preparing the electrode material on a large-scale and at low cost make the reported strategy very attractive for development of supercapacitors based on the covalent attachment of suitable molecules onto graphene toward high-synergy hybrids.",10403.0,"Bakandritsos, Aristeidis:Chronopoulos, Dimitrios:Jakubec, Petr:Pykal, Martin:Čépe, Klára:Steriotis, Theodore:Kalytchuk, Sergii:Petr, Martin:Zbořil, Radek:Otyepka, Michal",ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS,2,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A combined timing/spectral study of IRAS 13224-3809 using XMM-Newton data,"We present the results from an X-ray variability study of IRAS 13224-3809. This is probably the best source for X-ray reverberation studies since it is X-ray bright, extremely variable, and it has been extensively observed with XMM-Newton. We used all the archival XMM-Newton data from the three EPIC cameras (to increase the signal to noise) and, given the many observations of the source, we were able to compute the time lags spectra in three different flux levels/periods. We fitted the time lags and energy spectra, simultaneously, using a new X-ray reverberation code that computes the time-dependent reflection spectra of the disc as a response to an X-ray flash from a point source located on the axis of the black hole (BH) accretion disc (lamp-post geometry). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time for active galactic nuclei that both time lags and energy spectra are fitted by a model simultaneously in different flux periods. The model fits in the case when the BH is rapidly rotating are significantly better than the model fits in the case of a Schwarzschild BH. This result strongly favours the hypothesis of a rotating central BH in this source. We also detect significant variations in the height of the X-ray corona. The X-ray height appears to increase from similar to 3-5 gravitational radii when the X-ray luminosity is of the order of similar to 1.5-3 per cent of the Eddington limit, up to similar to 10 gravitational radii, when the luminosity doubles.",10308.0,"Caballero-García, María Dolores:Papadakis, I.E.:Dovčiak, Michal:Bursa, Michal:Svoboda, Jiří:Karas, Vladimír",Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,2,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Knowledge, Representation and the Dynamics of Computation","Cognitive processes are often modelled in computational terms. Can this still be done if only minimal assumptions are made about any sort of representation of reality? Is there a purely knowledge-based theory of computation that explains the key phenomena which are deemed to be computational in both living and artificial systems as understood today? We argue that this can be done by means of techniques inspired by the modelling of dynamical systems. In this setting, computations are defined as curves in suitable metaspaces and knowledge is generated by virtue of the operation of the underlying mechanism, whatever it is. Desirable properties like compositionality will be shown to fit naturally. The framework also enables one to formally characterize the computational behaviour of both knowledge generation and knowledge recognition.

"Distinct patterns of imprecise consonant articulation among Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy","Distinct speech characteristics that may aid in differentiation between Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) remain tremendously under-explored. Here, the patterns and degree of consonant articulation deficits across voiced and voiceless stop plosives in 16 PD, 16 PSP, 16 MSA and 16 healthy control speakers were evaluated using acoustic and perceptual methods. Imprecise consonant articulation was observed across all Parkinsonian groups. Voice onset time of voiceless plosives was more prolonged in both PSP and MSA compared to PD, presumably due to greater severity of dysarthria and slower articulation rate. Voice onset time of voiced plosives was significantly shorter only in MSA, likely as a consequence of damage to cerebellar structures. In agreement with the reduction of pre-voicing, MSA manifested increased number of voiced plosives misclassified as voiceless at perceptual evaluation. Timing of articulatory movements may provide important clues about the pathophysiology of underlying disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The slope efficiency increased from 19.6% of the straight fiber to 23.9% of the coiled only fiber and 29.4% of the simultaneously coiled and twisted fiber,0.0,"Koška, Pavel:Peterka, Pavel:Aubrecht, Jan:Podrazký, Ondřej:Todorov, Filip:Becker, M.:Baravets, Yauhen:Honzátko, Pavel:Kašík, Ivan",Optics Express,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Late Insertion and Root Suppletion,"This article proposes a Nanosyntactic Late­Insertion approach to root suppletion. We show that this theory allows us to account for root suppletion within a strictly modular theory of grammar, which makes no syntactic distinction between different roots. As a starting point, we first focus on the architectural difficulties that arise for a modular theory of roots in the Distributed Morphology approach. We then show how Nanosyntax circumvents these problems, and address two potential empirical issues for the Nanosyntactic treatment (multiple exponence and locality), showing that they in fact provide support for the approach proposed.",60203.0,"Vanden Wyngaerd, Guido:De Clercq, Karen:Caha, Pavel",Revista Virtual de Estudos da Linguagem - ReVEL,2,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Impact of silica fume, fly ash, and metakaolin on the thickness and strength of the ITZ in concrete","The interfacial transition zone (ITZ) has a major detrimental impact on the structural performance of concrete. This negative impact can be modulated by introducing mineral admixtures to a concrete mix, which fill the excessive voids within ITZ and react with portlandite to form more compact products. The approach described here, consisting of characterization of phases and micromechanical modeling, enabled assessment of the effect of silica fume, fly ash, and metakaolin on ITZ thickness and strength. The proposed model was based on the Mori-Tanaka scheme coupled with an estimation of deviatoric stress within ITZ. This study suggests that silica fume is efficient in reducing ITZ thickness, while the addition of fly ash more significantly contributes to ITZ strength. Moderate replacements of Portland cement for silica fume or fly ash, up to 20%, can positively influence concrete performance, in case of metakaolin, replacement up to 10% is recommended.",20101.0,"Nežerka, Václav:Bílý, Petr:Fládr, Josef:Hrbek, Vladimír",Cement and Concrete Composites,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maintenance Treatment and Survival in Patients With Myeloma A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis,"IMPORTANCE Several trials demonstrated the impact of novel agent-based maintenance in newly diagnosed multiplemyeloma (NDMM), but there is no current evidence demonstrating the superiority of one regimen over the other, owing to the lack of direct/indirect comparisons. OBJECTIVE To analyze and compare the effectiveness of different maintenance regimens in NDMM via a network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES We performed 2 independent searches in PubMed and Cochrane databases, and thenwe identified all the records registered after 1999 and on or before November 20, 2017. STUDY SELECTION By blinded review, we identified prospective phase 3 randomized trials evaluating novel agent-based maintenance in patients with NDMM, the included studies compared at least 2 maintenance approaches, comparators included placebo and no maintenance. From 364 screened records, 11 studies were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS We followed (independent extraction) the guidelines provided by the PRISMA Report and the EQUATOR Network. The evidence was synthesized using a network meta-analysis (NMA). To allow comparison of all treatments, no maintenance was selected as common comparator and the effect of placebo was assumed to be the same as no treatment. The best option was identified by a Bayesian consistency model based on hazard ratio (HR), 95% credible interval (CrI), probability of being the best treatment (PbBT), and median ranking distribution (MedR). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes of interestwere progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Eleven trials and 8 treatments including a total of 5073 participants were included. By PFS analysis, lenalidomide-based regimens (lenalidomide-prednisone, lenalidomide alone) were identified as the most effective options (HR, 0.39 [95% CrI, 0.28-0.53] and 0.47 [95% CrI, 0.39-0.55], respectively, MedR, 1 and 2, overall PbBT, 74%). Four treatments (thalidomide-interferon, thalidomide-bortezomib, bortezomib-prednisone, thalidomide alone) showed an HR in favor of maintenance. By OS analysis, lenalidomide alone was identified as the best option (HR, 0.76, 95% CrI, 0.51-1.16, MedR, 2, PbBT, 38%), followed by bortezomib-thalidomide and bortezomib-prednisone. Similar features were noticed in the restricted network including transplant trials, in the sensitivity analysis, and in most of the prognostic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Based on PFS and OS results of this NMA, lenalidomide maintenance appears to be the best treatment option, by synthesizing the available evidence of novel agent-based maintenance in the past 20 years.",30204.0,"Gay, F.:Jackson, G.:Rosinol, L.:Holstein, S.A.:Moreau, P.:Spada, S.:Davies, F.:Lahuerta, J.J.:Leleu, X.:Bringhen, S.:Evangelista, A.:Hulin, C.:Panzani, U.:Cairns, D.A.:Di Raimondo, F.:Macro, M.:Liberati, A.M.:Pawlyn, C.:Offidani, M.:Spencer, A.:Hájek, Roman:Terpos, E.:Morgan, G.J.:Blade, J.:Sonneveld, P.:San-Miguel, J.:McCarthy, P.L.:Ludwig, H.:Boccadoro, M.:Mateos, MV:Attal, M.",Jama Oncology,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Allium discoloration: color compounds formed during greening of processed garlic,"Structures and formation pathways of compounds responsible for blue-green discoloration of processed garlic were studied in model systems. A procedure was developed for isolation of the color compounds and their tentative identification by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS. It was found that the pigment is a mixture of numerous pyrrole-based purple/blue and yellow species. Experiments with isotope-labeled precursors revealed that two molecules of an amino acid are involved in the formation of each color compound. In the purple/blue species (?max 565?600 nm), both amino acid molecules are incorporated into two 3,4-dimethylpyrrole-derived rings linked together by a propenylidine bridge.

"Distinguishing the glycan isomers 2,3-sialyllactose and 2,6-sialyllactose by voltammetry after modification with osmium(VI) complexes","Altered glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells and certain glycans are well-known markers of tumor progression. In this work we studied two glycan isomers, 2,3-sialyllactose (3-SL) and 2,6-sialyllactose (6-SL), frequently appearing in glycoproteins connected with cancer. A combination of square wave voltammetry and glycan modification with osmium(VI) N, N, N', N'-tetramethylethylenedi-amine (Os(VI) tem) allowed to distinguish between these regioisomers, since the 6-SL molecule can bind three Os(VI), while the 3-SL only two Os(VI) moieties, as experiments using capillary electrophoresis, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and thin layer chromatography showed. A similar pattern of Os(VI)-modification was found for isomers of sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine and sialylgalactose. Covalent adducts of Os(VI) tem with glycans yielded three reduction voltammetric peaks. The ratio of peak I/peak II heights depends on the content of individual regioisomer in the sample. Our proposed approach allows the determination of isomer percentage representation in the mixture after one voltammogram recording. These results show a new appropriate method for the discrimination of glycan isomers containing terminal sialic acid important for distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous origin of biomarkers.

The role of evolution in shaping ecological networks,"The structure of ecological networks reflects the evolutionary history of their biotic components, and their dynamics are strongly driven by ecoevolutionary processes. Here, we present an appraisal of recent relevant research, in which the pervasive role of evolution within ecological networks is manifest. Although evolutionary processes are most evident at macroevolutionary scales, they are also important drivers of local network structure and dynamics. We propose components of a blueprint for further research, emphasising process-based models, experimental evolution, and phenotypic variation, across a range of distinct spatial and temporal scales.

Effects of Ducting on Whistler Mode Chorus or Exohiss in the Outer Radiation Belt,"Previously published statistics based on Cluster spacecraft measurements surprisingly show that in the outer radiation belt, lower band whistler mode waves predominantly propagate unattenuated parallel to the magnetic field lines up to midlatitudes, where ray tracing simulations indicated highly attenuated waves with oblique wave vectors. We explain this behavior by considering a large fraction of ducted waves. We argue that these ducts can be weak and thin enough to be difficult to detect by spacecraft instrumentation while being strong enough to guide whistler mode waves in a cold plasma ray tracing simulation. After adding a tenuous hot electron population, we obtain a strong effect of Landau damping on unducted waves, while the ducted waves experience less damping or even growth. Consequently, the weighted average of amplitudes and wave normal angles of a mixture of ducted and unducted waves provides us with strong quasi-parallel waves, consistent with the observations.",10305.0,"Hanzelka, Miroslav:Santolík, Ondřej",Geophysical Research Letters,2,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Radical theory of hydride atomization confirmed after four decades - determination of H radicals in a quartz hydride atomizer by two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence,"In an externally heated quartz atomizer, the most often used hydride atomizer for atomic absorption spectrometry, two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence (TALIF) was employed (i) to bring after four decades for the first time conclusive proof of the existence of H radical population sufficient to atomize hydrides thus confirming unambiguously the radical theory of hydride atomization and (ii) to determine the distribution of H radicals in the atomizer. Under typical operating conditions, H radicals are concentrated in an approximately 3 mm long cloud in the center of the optical arm and their peak concentration exceeds 1022 m 3, i.e. four orders of magnitude above the typical analytical concentration of hydride. The lowest detectable H radical concentration is in the order of 1019 m 3. The superb power of TALIF to determine the spatial distribution of H radicals in hydride atomizers for atomic absorption/fluorescence provides a route for elegant optimization of hydride atomization – just by establishing how the atomizer design and parameters influence the distribution of H radicals.",10406.0,"Dvořák, P.:Talába, M.:Kratzer, Jan:Dědina, Jiří",Chemical Science,2,high,high,1,1,high,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Reinforcement Learning-Based Distributed BESS Management for Mitigating Overvoltage Issues in Systems with High PV Penetration,"High levels of penetration of distributed photovoltaic generators can cause serious overvoltage issues, especially during periods of high power generation and light loads. There have been many solutions proposed to mitigate the voltage problems, some of them using battery energy storage systems (BESS) at the PV generation sites. In addition to their ability to absorb extra power during the light load periods, BESS can also supply additional power under high load conditions. However, their capacity may not be sufficient to allow charging every time when power absorption is desired. Therefore, typical PV/BESS may not fully prevent over-voltage problems in power distribution grids. This work develops a cooperative state of charge control scheme to alleviate the BESS capacity problem through Monte Carlo tree search based reinforcement learning (MCTS-RL). The proposed intelligent method coordinates the distributed batteries from other regions to provide voltage regulation in a distribution network. Furthermore, the energy optimization process during the day hours and the simultaneous state of charge control are achieved using model predictive control (MPC). The proposed approach is demonstrated on two test cases, the IEEE 33 bus system and a practical medium size distribution system in Alberta Canada.",20202.0,"Al-Saffar, Mohammed:Musílek, Petr",IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,2,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ETR1 Integrates Response to Ethylene and Cytokinins into a Single Multistep Phosphorelay Pathway to Control Root Growth,"Cytokinins and ethylene control plant development via sensors from the histidine kinase (HK) family. However, downstreamsignaling pathways for the key phytohormones are distinct. Here we report that not only cytokinin but also ethylene is able to control root apical meristem (RAM) size through activation of the multi-step phosphorelay (MSP) pathway. We found that both cytokinin and ethylene-dependent RAM shortening requires ethylene binding to ETR1 and the HK activity of ETR1. The receiver domain of ETR1 interacts with MSP signaling intermediates acting downstream of cytokinin receptors, further substantiating the role of ETR1 in MSP signaling. We revealed that both cytokinin and ethylene induce the MSP in similar and distinct cell types with ETR1-mediated ethylene signaling controlling MSP output specifically in the root transition zone. We identified members of the MSP pathway specific and common to both hormones and showed that ETR1-regulated ARR3 controls RAM size. ETR1-mediated MSP spatially differs from canonical CTR1/EIN2/ EIN3 ethylene signaling and is independent of EIN2, indicating that both pathways can be spatially and functionally separated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that canonical ethylene signaling controls MSP responsiveness to cytokinin specifically in the root transition zone, presumably via regulation of ARR10, one of the positive regulators of MSP signaling in Arabidopsis.",10608.0,"Žďárská, Markéta:Cuyacot, Abigail Rubiato:Tarr, P.T.:Yamoune, Amel:Szmitkowska, Agnieszka:Hrdinová, Vendula:Gelová, Zuzana:Meyerowitz, E.M.:Hejátko, Jan",Molecular Plant,2,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Pavlov I: A large Gravettian site in space and time,"The formation of the large site clusters of the Gravettian (Pavlovian) represents one of the final effects of modern human adaptation in central Europe, but chronology of the site formation processes at such sites are still little understood. Here we present new evidence from Pavlov I, a site now prepared for the construction of a museum and subjected to a large-scale preparatory excavation. Understanding the spatial organisation, microstratigraphies, and the effects of cryogenic processes on the site formation is the basic presumption for lithic analysis at a large and complex site. Obviously, these extensive sites have a longer prehistory than was previously thought. The detection of the Early Upper Palaeolithic/Gravettian boundary was related to a radical change in the lithic raw material composition. The early and evolved Gravettian industries complete previously recorded the techno/typological spectrum by additional microlithic assemblages.

"Bi-allelic ADARB1 Variants Associated with Microcephaly, Intellectual Disability, and Seizures","The RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 is essential for the recoding of brain transcripts. Impaired ADAR2 editing leads to early-onset epilepsy and premature death in a mouse model. Here, we report bi-allelic variants in ADARB1, the gene encoding ADAR2, in four unrelated individuals with microcephaly, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. In one individual, a homozygous variant in one of the double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) was identified. In the others, variants were situated in or around the deaminase domain. To evaluate the effects of these variants on ADAR2 enzymatic activity, we performed in vitro assays with recombinant proteins in HEK293T cells and ex vivo assays with fibroblasts derived from one of the individuals. We demonstrate that these ADAR2 variants lead to reduced editing activity on a known ADAR2 substrate. We also demonstrate that one variant leads to changes in splicing of ADARB1 transcript isoforms.

Coherent and incoherent J/psi photonuclear production in an energy-dependent hot-spot model,"In a previous publication, we have presented a model for the photoproduction of J/psi vector mesons off protons, where the proton structure in the impact-parameter plane is described by an energy-dependent hot-spot profile. Here we extend this model to study the photonuclear production of J/psi vector mesons in coherent and incoherent interactions of heavy nuclei. We study two methods to extend the model to the nuclear case: using the standard Glauber-Gribov formalism and using geometric scaling to obtain the nuclear saturation scale. We find that the incoherent cross section changes sizably with the inclusion of subnucleonic hot spots and that this change is energy dependent. We propose to search for this behavior by measuring the ratio of the incoherent to coherent cross sections at different energies. We compare the results of our model to results from the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and from run 1 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), finding satisfactory agreement. We also present predictions for the LHC at the new energies reached in run 2.

"Effect of dietary fat type on intestinal digestibility of fatty acids, fatty acid profiles of breast meat and abdominal fat, and mRNA expression of lipid-related genes in broiler chickens","A group of 240-day-old Ross cockerels were used in a 4-week experiment to assess the effect of the fat type on the intestinal digestibility of fatty acids (FAs), the FA profiles of breast meat and abdominal fat, and the mRNA expression of six hepatic lipid-related genes. Experimental diets were supplemented with rapeseed oil, pork lard or palm oil at 60 g/kg. In the control diet, wheat starch was substituted for the fat source. The highest ileal digestibility of the fat and all FAs (except stearic acid) was observed in chickens fed lard. The content of fat in the breast meat of chickens was not significantly influenced by the fat supplements. The FA profiles of breast meat and abdominal fat reflected the FA composition of the diet. In the meat of chickens fed rapeseed oil, oleic acid was the predominant FA. Palmitic acid was the most abundant FA in the meat of chickens fed lard or palm oil. Oleic acid was the most abundant FA in the abdominal fat of all chickens. The highest mRNA expression of desaturases (Δ5-, Δ6- and Δ9-) was observed in chickens fed palm oil. The mRNA expression of hepatic FA synthase was higher in chickens fed palm oil or lard than in chickens fed rapeseed oil. The expression of HMG-CoA reductase was higher in chickens fed palm oil than in those fed rapeseed oil or lard. It can be concluded that rapeseed oil and lard are better sources of lipids than palm oil. These former two sources contain more digestible fatty acids and provide a lower concentration of SFAs in the meat and fat of chickens.",40201.0,"Skřivan, Miloš:Marounek, Milan:Englmaierová, Michaela:Čermák, Ladislav:Vlčková, Jana:Skřivanová, Eva",PLoS One,2,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The influence of situational information on pupils' achievement in additive word problems with several states and transformations,"Research has shown that word problem difficulty is influenced by various linguistic, numerical and general variables, but results in this area are inconsistent. This paper focuses on the question of how the order of numerical data, the context, the position of the unknown transformation, and the length of the statement in an additive word problem, influence the achievement and reasoning of primary pupils. These variables were varied in two word problems requiring additive reasoning and these variants were solved by pupils in Grades 4 and 5 from four Prague primary schools. Item Response Theory was used both for the division of the pupils into four equally able groups each solving a different variant of the word problem, and for the quantitative interpretation of data. The pupils&apos, solutions were also analysed in a qualitative way.

However, an effect of cross-linking on protein structure and function should not be forgotten, and surprisingly, it has not been investigated in detail so far. Here, we used kinetic studies, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy to systematically investigate an impact of cross-linking on structure and function of human carbonic anhydrase and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Insights into the evolutionary history and widespread occurrence of antheridiogen systems in ferns,"Sex expression of homosporous ferns is controlled by multiple factors, one being the antheridiogen system. Antheridiogens are pheromones released by sexually mature female fern gametophytes, turning nearby asexual gametophytes precociously male. Nevertheless, not all species respond. It is still unknown how many fern species use antheridiogens, how the antheridiogen system evolved, and whether it is affected by polyploidy and/or apomixis. We tested the response of 68 fern species to antheridiogens in cultivation. These results were combined with a comprehensive review of literature to form the largest dataset of antheridiogen interactions to date. Analyzed species also were coded as apomictic or sexual and diploid or polyploid. Our final dataset contains a total of 498 interactions involving 208 species (c. 2% of all ferns). About 65% of studied species respond to antheridiogen. Multiple antheridiogen types were delimited and their evolution is discussed. Antheridiogen responsiveness was not significantly affected by apomixis or polyploidy. Antheridiogens are widely used by ferns to direct sex expression. The antheridiogen system likely evolved multiple times and provides homosporous ferns with the benefits often associated with heterospory, such as increased rates of outcrossing. Despite expectations, antheridiogens may be beneficial to polyploids and apomicts.",10611.0,"Hornych, Ondřej:Testo, Weston L:Sessa, Emily B:Watkins, James E.

The magnetic nature of umbra-penumbra boundary in sunspots,"We aim at studying the magnetic nature of umbra-penumbra boundaries in sunspots of different sizes, morphologies, evolutionary stages, and phases of the solar cycle. We statistically prove that the umbra-penumbra boundary in stable sunspots is characterised by an invariant value of the vertical magnetic field component: the vertical component of the magnetic field strength does not depend on the umbra size, its morphology, and phase of the solar cycle. With the statistical Bayesian inference, we find that the strength of the vertical magnetic field component is, with a likelihood of 99%, in the range of 1849-1885 G with the most probable value of 1867 G. In contrast, the magnetic field strength and inclination averaged along individual boundaries are found to be dependent on the umbral size: the larger the umbra, the stronger and more horizontal the magnetic field at its boundary.",10308.0,"Jurčák, Jan:Rezaei, R.:Bello González, N.:Schlichenmaier, R.:Vomlel, Jiří",Astronomy & Astrophysics,2,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Study of Decomposition of Chemical Warfare Agents using Solid Decontamination Substances,"The decontamination of chemical warfare agents is important for the elimination or reduction of the effects of these substances on persons. Solid decontamination (degradation) sorbents that decompose dangerous substances belong among modern decontamination substances. The aim of the study was to design a procedure for monitoring the degradation of chemical warfare agents using such sorbents. The degradation of soman, VX [O-ethyl-S-(diisopropylaminoethyl)methylphosphonothioate] and sulphur mustard (chemical warfare agents) was monitored using FTIR spectrometry with the attenuated total reflection (ATR) technique. During the development and validation of this process, bonds were found in the substance molecule that decomposed and the positions of the absorbance bands corresponded to the vibration of these bonds. The evaluation of the degradation efficiency procedure for sorbents on chemical warfare agents was designed based on this study.

All the prepared photocatalysts were tested for the CO2 photocatalytic reduction in a stirred batch reactor. The main reaction product was methane, however, hydrogen and carbon monoxide were also detected. The textural, (micro)structural, optical and electronic properties of photocatalysts were characterized in detailby low-temperature nitrogen physisorption, X-ray powder diffraction, EDX, HRTEM, X-ray fluorescence,X-ray photon spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the photocatalysts were determined using photoelectric spectrometry. The highest yields of CH4, H2 and CO were achieved in the presence of 2 wt. % Cu/TiO2, 0.5 wt. % Cu/TiO2 and pure, amorphous TiO2.

The climatic drivers of primary Picea forest growth along the Carpathian arc are changing under rising temperatures,"Climatic constraints on tree growth mediate an important link between terrestrial and atmospheric carbon pools. Tree rings provide valuable information on climate-driven growth patterns, but existing data tend to be biased toward older trees on climatically extreme sites. Understanding climate change responses of biogeographic regions requires data that integrate spatial variability in growing conditions and forest structure. We analyzed both temporal (c. 1901-2010) and spatial variation in radial growth patterns in 9,876 trees from fragments of primary Picea abies forests spanning the latitudinal and altitudinal extent of the Carpathian arc. Growth was positively correlated with summer temperatures and spring moisture availability throughout the entire region. However, important seasonal variation in climate responses occurred along geospatial gradients. At northern sites, winter precipitation and October temperatures of the year preceding ring formation were positively correlated with ring width.

Triptycene Induced Enhancement of Membrane Gas Selectivity for Microporous Tröger's Base Polymers,"PIM-Trip-TB provides highly impressive gas permeation data for a number of commercially relevant gas pairs including O2 / N2, H2 /N2 and CO2 /CH4 in terms of permeability, selectivity and position relative to the 2008 Robeson upper bound. This performance is based on exceptional diffusivity selectivity of gas transport. The lack of methyl groups in PIM-Trip-TB may enhance performance as compared to PIM-EA-TB, within which methyl rotary motion may reduce diffusivity selectivity. Indeed, as PIM-Trip-TB is a ladder polymer that is composed of only benzene rings fused together by rigid bridged bicyclic units and contains no groups that can act as rotors, its performance as a molecular sieve is likely to be approaching the optimum achievable for gas separation for a solution processable polymer.

AP will synthesize a whole expression at once. The latter case, the AP will create chaotic controller that secures the stabilization of stable state and high periodic orbit-oscillations between several values of discrete chaotic system.

Robust partial-load experiments with Showstopper,"Concurrent execution of multiple applications leads to varying partial utilization of shared resources. Understanding system behavior in these conditions is essential for making concurrent execution efficient. Unfortunately, anticipating behavior of shared resources at partial utilization in complex systems is difficult, realistic experiments that reproduce and examine such behavior are therefore needed. To facilitate experiments at partial utilization, we present a tool that accurately controls the processor utilization of arbitrary concurrent workloads, either establishing constant partial load or replaying a variable load trace. We validate the ability of the tool to enforce the configured partial utilization on multiple platforms, and use the tool to collect novel information on system behavior at partial utilization levels. In detail, our experiments show how to examine the complex relationship between utilization and throughput, useful for tasks such as performance debugging or system dimensioning, and we show this relationship for the DaCapo benchmarks. Further, we show that CPU pinning (a technique used to improve workload isolation) can benefit from dynamic response to system utilization, improving system efficiency with partial utilization. Finally, we show that the overhead of virtualization also changes with partial utilization and CPU allocation.",0.0,"Podzimek, Andrej:Bulej, Lubomír:Chen, Lydia Y.:Binder, Walter:Tůma, Petr",Future Generation Computer Systems,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Composition and Function of Chicken Gut Microbiota,"Studies analysing composition of gut microbiota are quite common at presence, mainly due to the extreme development in DNA sequencing technologies within last decade. This is valid also for chickens and their gut microbiota. However, chickens represent specific model for host – microbiota interactions since contact between parents and offspring has been completely interrupted in domesticated chickens. Nearly all studies handle with chicks from hatcheries and consider such chickens as reference and control. In fact, such chickens represent extreme experimental group since control chicks should be those hatched in nests, in a contact with parent hen. Not properly realising this fact results, together with a use of only 16S rRNA sequencing, in many conclusions of questionable biological relevance. Specifics of chickens related to gut microbiota are therefore stressed in this review together with current knowledge on biological role of selected microbiota members.

Dissecting gamma frequency activity during human memory processing,"Gamma frequency activity (30–150 Hz) is induced in cognitive tasks and is thought to reflect underlying neural processes. Gamma frequency activity can be recorded directly from the human brain using intracranial electrodes implanted in patients undergoing treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. Previous studies have independently explored narrowband oscillations in the local field potential and broadband power increases. It is not clear, however, which processes contribute to human brain gamma frequency activity, or their dynamics and roles during memory processing. Here a large dataset of intracranial recordings obtained during encoding of words from 101 patients was used to detect, characterize and compare induced gamma frequency activity events. Individual bursts of gamma frequency activity were isolated in the time-frequency domain to determine their spectral features, including peak frequency, amplitude, frequency span, and duration. We found two distinct types of gamma frequency aktivity events that showed either narrowband or broadband frequency spans revealing characteristic spectral properties. Narrowband events, the predominant type, were induced by word presentations following an initial induction of broadband events, which were temporally separated and selectively correlated with evoked response potentials, suggesting that they reflect different neural activities and play different roles during memory encoding. The two gamma frequency activity types were differentially modulated during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words. In conclusion, we found evidence for two distinct activity types induced in the gamma frequency range during cognitive processing. Separating these two gamma frequency activity components contributes to the current understanding of electrophysiological biomarkers, and may prove useful for emerging neurotechnologies targeting, mapping and modulating distinct neurophysiological processes in normal and epileptogenic brain.",20205.0,"Kucewicz, M.T.:Berry, B.M.:Křemen, Václav:Brinkmann, B.H.:Sperling, M.R.:Jobst, B.C.:Gross, R.E.:Lega, B.:Sheth, S.A.:Stein, J.M.:S.R., Das:Gorniak, R.:Stead, S.M.:Rizzuto, D.S.:Kahana, M.J.:Worrell, G.A.",Brain,2,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Plasma Waste Destruction,"The chapter analyzes physical and technological aspects of waste treatment using thermal plasma technology. The waste treatment problems are briefly characterized and an overview of methods of waste treatment is presented. Main industrial scale plasma waste treatment units installed in the world are described. Basic principles of plasma waste treatment systems are presented and processes of waste-to-energy conversion by plasma gasification of organics are analyzed. Potential advantages of using plasma for gasification are summarized, fundamental chemistry of the plasma gasification process as well as basic thermodynamics, the energy balance and the kinetics of the process are described. Examples of results of thermal plasma gasification of various organic wastes are presented. Produced gas compositions for different feed materials are shown, including sawdust, wooden pellets, brown coal, polyethylene and pyrolytic oil produced from car tires. The results show that it is possible to produce syngas of high hydrogen and carbon monoxide content, with low levels of contaminants, and with a high calorific value. Plasma gasification is a process with huge potential for converting low-value materials to a high-value fuel, syngas.

Myocardial iron content and mitochondrial function in human heart failure: a direct tissue analysis,"Iron replacement improves clinical status in iron-deficient patients with heart failure (HF), but the pathophysiology is poorly understood. The impact of myocardial iron deficiency (MID) on mitochondrial function, measured directly in the failing human heart, is unknown. Left ventricular samples were obtained from 91 consecutive HF patients and 38 HF-free organ donors (controls). Total myocardial iron content, mitochondrial respiration, citric acid cycle and respiratory chain enzyme activities, and content of OXPHOS complexes and ROS-protective enzymes were measured in tissue homogenates to quantify mitochondrial function. Myocardial iron content was lower in HF compared with controls (156 +/- 41 vs. 200 +/- 38 mu g.g(-1) dry weight, P < 0.001), independently of anaemia. MID was associated with more extensive coronary disease and less beta-blocker usage compared with non-MID HF patients. Compared with controls, HF patients displayed reduced myocardial oxygen respiration and reduced activity of all examined mitochondrial enzymes (all P < 0.001). MID in HF was associated with preserved activity of respiratory chain enzymes but reduced activity of aconitase and citrate synthase (by -26% and -15%, P < 0.05) and reduced expression of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase 2. Myocardial iron content is decreased and mitochondrial functions are impaired in advanced HF. MID in HF is associated with diminished citric acid cycle enzyme activities and decreased ROS-protecting enzymes. MID may contribute to altered myocardial substrate use and to worsening of mitochondrial dysfunction that exists in HF.",10608.0,"Melenovský, V.:Petrák, J.:Mráček, Tomáš:Beneš, J.:Borlaug, B.

Nafion membranes modified by cationic cyclodextrin derivatives for enantioselective separation.,"Nafion117® membranes modified by three cationic cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives have been prepared by strong ionic bonding. All CD derivatives contained bis(methylimidazolium) (MIM2) cationic anchor covalently bound to the CD unit, either using no spacer or using diethylene glycol (DEG) or tetraethylene glycol (TEEG) spacers. The modified membranes were tested in chiral separation of a model racemic mixture (d/l-tryptophan) from water. Different experimental set-ups for characterising membranes in enantioselective separation – pertraction, two kinds of sorption, and pressure-driven membrane separation – have been described and rigorously compared. The membranes CD-MIM2, CD-DEG-MIM2 have reached the highest enantiomeric excess, 14 and 44% respectively, in 280 days. The lowest performance of the CD-TEEG-MIM2 membrane, with the long spacer, has been visibly ameliorated by applying pertraction, enantiomeric excess rose from 2 to 27% in 80 days. Even though sorption played the main role in pertraction, this process substantially enhanced the separation of racemic mixtures. The pressure-driven approach has allowed the operation to be continuous and faster, which has the potential for continuous large-scale production of enantiopure compounds and could pave the way for many more commercial applications, satisfying the considerable demand for large-scale chiral separation techniques.",20402.0,"Gaálová, Jana:Michel, Marine:Bourassi, Mahdi:Ladewing, B.P.:Kasal, P.:Jindřich, J.:Izák, Pavel",Separation and Purification Technology,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Climate Mobility and Development Cooperation,"Development cooperation actors have been addressing climate change as a cross-cutting issue and investing in climate adaptation projects since the early 2000s. More recently, as concern has risen about the potential impacts of climate variability and change on human mobility, development cooperation actors have begun to design projects that intentionally address the drivers of migration, including climate impacts on livelihoods. However, to date, we know little about the development cooperation&apos,s role and function in responding to climate related mobility and migration. As such, the main aim of this paper is to outline the policy frameworks and approaches shaping development cooperation actors&apos, engagement and to identify areas for further exploration and investment. First, we frame the concept of climate mobility and migration and discuss some applicable policy frameworks that govern the issue from various perspectives, secondly, we review the toolbox of approaches that development cooperation actors bring to climate mobility, and third, we discuss the implications of the current Covid-19 pandemic and identify avenues for the way forward. We conclude that ensuring safe and orderly mobility and the decent reception and long-term inclusion of migrants and displaced persons under conditions of more severe climate hazards, and in the context of rising nationalism and xenophobia, poses significant challenges. Integrated approaches across multiple policy sectors and levels of governance are needed. In addition to resources, development cooperation actors can bring data to help empower the most affected communities and regions and leverage their convening power to foster more coordinated approaches within and across countries.",50704.0,"Stojanov, Robert:Rosengaertner, Sarah:de Sherbinin, Alex:Nawrotzki, Raphael",Population and Environment,2,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Structure and architecture of immature and mature murine leukemia virus capsids,"Retroviruses assemble and bud from infected cells in an immature form and require proteolytic maturation for infectivity. The CA (capsid) domains of the Gag polyproteins assemble a protein lattice as a truncated sphere in the immature virion. Proteolytic cleavage of Gag induces dramatic structural rearrangements, a subset of cleaved CA subsequently assembles into the mature core, whose architecture varies among retroviruses. Murine leukemia virus (MLV) is the prototypical γ-retrovirus and serves as the basis of retroviral vectors, but the structure of the MLV CA layer is unknown. Here we have combined X-ray crystallography with cryoelectron tomography to determine the structures of immature and mature MLV CA layers within authentic viral particles. This reveals the structural changes associated with maturation, and, by comparison with HIV-1, uncovers conserved and variable features. In contrast to HIV-1, most MLV CA is used for assembly of the mature core, which adopts variable, multilayered morphologies and does not form a closed structure. Unlike in HIV-1, there is similarity between protein–protein interfaces in the immature MLV CA layer and those in the mature CA layer, and structural maturation of MLV could be achieved through domain rotations that largely maintain hexameric interactions. Nevertheless, the dramatic architectural change on maturation indicates that extensive disassembly and reassembly are required for mature core growth. The core morphology suggests that wrapping of the genome in CA sheets may be sufficient to protect the MLV ribonucleoprotein during cell entry. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

Low-energy electrons transform the nimorazole molecule into a radiosensitiser,"While matter is irradiated with highly-energetic particles, it may become chemically modified. Thereby, the reactions of free low-energy electrons (LEEs) formed as secondary particles play an important role. It is unknown to what degree and by which mechanism LEEs contribute to the action of electron-affinic radiosensitisers applied in radiotherapy of hypoxic tumours. Here we show that LEEs effectively cause the reduction of the radiosensitiser nimorazole via associative electron attachment with the cross-section exceeding most of known molecules. This supports the hypothesis that nimorazole is selectively cytotoxic to tumour cells due to reduction of the molecule as prerequisite for accumulation in the cell. In contrast, dissociative electron attachment, commonly believed to be the source of chemical activity of LEEs, represents only a minor reaction channel which is further suppressed upon hydration. Our results show that LEEs may strongly contribute to the radiosensitising effect of nimorazole via associative electron attachment.",10403.0,"Meissner, R.:Kočišek, Jaroslav:Feketeová, L.:Fedor, Juraj:Fárník, Michal:Limao-Vieira, P.:Illenberger, E.:Denifl, S.",Nature Communications,2,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Host population density and presence of predators as key factors influencing the number of gregarious parasitoid Anaphes flavipes offspring,"The number of parasitoids developed per host is one of the major factors that influences future adult body size and reproductive success. Here, we examined four external factors (host species, heritability, host population density, and presence of predators) that can affect the number of the gregarious parasitoid Anaphes flavipes (Forster, 1841) (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) wasps developing in one host. The effect of host population density on the number of parasitoid offspring developed per host was confirmed, and for the first time, we also showed that the number of offspring per host is influenced by the presence of predators.

Higher Tl bioaccessibility in white mustard (hyper-accumulator) grown under the soil than hydroponic conditions: A key factor for the phytoextraction use.,"The paper deals with the thallium (Tl) access into the white mustard (Sinapis alba L.). We were comparing two approaches: A - hydroponic, B - semi-hydroponic (artificial soil). The kinetics of Tl plant uptake at different available Tl doses (0.1, 0.05 and 0.01 mg L-1) was tested. It was revealed that the hydroponic arrangement did not accelerate the plant uptake of Tl. The concentration of plant Tl was surprisingly roughly double under the semi-hydroponic (artificial soil) conditions as compared to the hydroponic system, the highest Tl concentrations were detected in stems, proving an important role of plant grown strategy on Tl bioaccessibility. We found that almost independently of the initial dose of Tl the juvenile stadium of the mustard can preserve1-2% of the total Tl pool. Up to 95% of this Tl dose is stored in the shoots. The different strategy of the plant growing may strongly affect the path of Tl incorporation. The total Tl input into the leaf tissue in hydroponics may be from 69% (p = 0.01) explained by parallel assimilation of Ca. In contrast, the Tl entry into the leaf grown on the artificial soil could be limited by Mn path (R2 = 0.91, p = 0.01).",40100.0,"Vaněk, Aleš:Milhaljevič, Martin:Vejvodová, Kateřina:Holubík, Ondřej",Journal of Environmental Management,2,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with aleukemic prodrome: preleukemic dynamics and possible mechanisms of immunosurveillance,"The development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) typically involves the acquisition of at least two genetic events. The initial mutation leads to the formation of a persistent, but clinically covert, preleukemic clone. Additional genetic changes then lead, in a stepwise manner, to complete leukemic transformation and promote the clinical onset of the disease.We analyzed eight children with B-cell precursor ALL who had a prodromal period of atypical anemia along with fatigue and infections GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO6 weeks before the clinical diagnosis of leukemia (Table 1). As a hematologic disorder was suspected, BM aspirates were investigated by morphology and flow cytometry. Initially, the diagnostic criteria of ALL were not fulfilled and thus no antileukemic treatment was started except for low doses of corticosteroids in three patients. However, continuous follow-up was indicated and after a premalignant period lasting from 42 days up to 17 months the diagnostic criteria were met and the diagnosis of B-cell precursor ALL was finally confirmed in all eight patients.

Predicting corporate investment/non-investment grade by using interval-valued fuzzy rule-based systems-A cross-region analysis,"Systems for predicting corporate rating have attracted considerable interest in soft computing research due to the requirements for both accuracy and interpretability. In addition, the high uncertainty associated primarily with linguistic uncertainties and disagreement among experts is another challenging problem. To overcome these problems, this study proposes a hybrid evolutionary interval-valued fuzzy rule-based system, namely IVTURS, combined with evolutionary feature selection component. This model is used to predict the investment/non-investment grades of companies from four regions, namely Emerging countries, the EU, the United States, and other developed countries. To evaluate prediction performance, a yield measure is used that combines the return and default rates of companies. Here, we show that using interval-valued fuzzy sets leads to higher accuracy, particularly with the growing granularity at the fuzzy partition level. The proposed prediction model is then compared with several state-of-the-art evolutionary fuzzy rule-based systems. The obtained results show that the proposed model is especially suitable for high-dimensional problems, without facing rule base interpretability issues. This finding indicates that the model is preferable for investors oriented toward developed markets such as the EU and the United States.",10201.0,"Hájek, Petr",Applied Soft Computing,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sources of shifts in pre-service teachers' patterns of attention: the roles of teaching experience and of observational experience,"A key requirement of successful initial teacher education is the development of professional vision, which includes shifting attention to features of the situation relevant to the specialized goals of teaching. Existing research hints at the value of targeted videobased courses in the development of professional vision, but often raises questions about the sources of shifts in the pattern of attention. We argue that existing work makes it difficult to distinguish whether shifts seen across video interventions are the results of the intervention, teaching experience, or methodological issues with the unbalanced use of videos in the data collection in these studies. Our first study suggests pre-service teachers&apos, teaching practice experience does not notably affect attention, but that choice of video does. Our second study addresses the methodological issues and suggests that we may discount different or unbalanced videos as a source of the shifts in the pattern of attention.

Porous heat-treated polyacrylonitrile scaffolds for bone tissue engineering,"Heat-treated polyacrylonitrile (HT-PAN), also referred to as black orlon (BO), is a promising carbon-based material used for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. To the best of our knowledge, no such complex bone morphology-mimicking three-dimensional (3D) BO structure has been reported to date. We report that BO can be easily made into 3D cryogel scaffolds with porous structures, using succinonitrile as a porogen. The cryogels possess a porous morphology, similar to bone tissue. The prepared scaffolds showed strong osteoconductive activity, providing excellent support for the adhesion, proliferation, and mitochondrial activity of human bone-derived cells. This effect was more apparent in scaffolds prepared from a matrix with a higher content of PAN (i.e., 10% rather than 5%). The scaffolds with 10% of PAN also showed enhanced mechanical properties, as revealed by higher compressive modulus and higher compressive strength.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor influences primary cilium length through an interaction with intestinal cell kinase,"Vertebrate primary cilium is a Hedgehog signaling center but the extent of its involvement in other signaling systems is less well understood. This report delineates a mechanism by which fibroblast growth factor (FGF) controls primary cilia. Employing proteomic approaches to characterize proteins associated with the FGF-receptor, FGFR3, we identified the serine/threonine kinase intestinal cell kinase (ICK) as an FGFR interactor. ICK is involved in ciliogenesis and participates in control of ciliary length. FGF signaling partially abolished ICK's kinase activity, through FGFR-mediated ICK phosphorylation at conserved residue Tyr15, which interfered with optimal ATP binding. Activation of the FGF signaling pathway affected both primary cilia length and function in a manner consistent with cilia effects caused by inhibition of ICK activity. Moreover, knockdown and knockout of ICK rescued the FGF-mediated effect on cilia. We provide conclusive evidence that FGF signaling controls cilia via interaction with ICK.",10608.0,"Kunová Bosáková, M.:Nita, A.:Gregor, T.:Vařecha, M.:Gudernová, I.:Fafílek, B.:Bárta, T.:Basheer, N.:Abraham, S.

Moods and Emotions,"I contend that moods and emotions are neither internal mental states, nor hard-wired reactions occurring in our brains. From the phenomenological point of view, they are experientially manifest as wholes that can be only ex post decomposed in what seem to be - once we adopt an objectivizing perspective - their components, such as cognitive appraisals, inner feelings, motor reactions, physiological arousals etc. Against the strong impulse to decompose moods and emotions into such empirically identifiable components, phenomenology points to the impossible task of reconstructing our affective life in its full sense out of determinate component-entities and provides the means to grasp emotional experience simultaneously in its primary indistinction and implicit articulation.

The colonisation of Czech travellers and expatriates living in the Czech Republic by colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and whole genome characterisation of E. coli isolates harbouring the mcr-1 genes on a plasmid or chromosome: A cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: Travellers were recognized as a risk cohort that can be colonized by mcr-1-mediated colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. We aimed to investigate the carriage of mcr-mediated colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in Czech travellers or expatriates residing temporarily in the Czech Republic. METHODS: Between August 2018 and September 2019, the stool samples were cultured in enrichment broth. The enriched cultures were tested for the presence of the mcr-1-8 genes and inoculated onto selective agar with colistin. Colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were tested for the presence of the mcr-1-8 genes, the mcr-positive isolates were characterised by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: From the 177 stool samples, 15 colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were cultured (7.9%), two of the E. coli isolates carried the mcr-1 gene (1.1%). In the E. coli multilocus sequence type (ST) 156, the mcr-1 gene was located in an ISApl1-mcr-1-orf-ISApl1 (Tn6330) and incorporated into the chromosome, in the E. coli ST23 isolate, the mcr-1 gene was harboured by the plasmid IncX4. Both of the mcr-1 positive E. coli isolates were multidrug-resistant and one isolate was an extended-spectrum β-lactamase producer (bla(CTX-M-27)).

Free relatives,"This chapter gives a detailed survey of the semantics of free relatives. After providing a brief characterization and typology of free relatives, the chapter reviews the arguments that have played a role in the debate about the semantic nature of free relatives. The arguments clearly support the traditional view that free relatives correspond to definite descriptions. At the same time, however, there is a class of ever free relatives, called here universal-like ever free relatives, which match the behavior of universal quantifiers. The chapter then turns to a discussion of so-called ever free relatives and particularly the modal inferences they convey - such as indifference or ignorance. A brief crosslinguistic survey is included, suggesting that ever free relatives are primarily non-modal, which in turn lends support to the approaches that attribute the potential modal inferences to a source external to the ever free relative itself.

"On-road and laboratory emissions of NO, NO2, NH3, N2O and CH4 from late-model EU light utility vehicles: Comparison of diesel and CNG","Exhaust emissions of eight Euro 6 light duty vehicles – two station wagons and six vans – half powered by diesel fuel and half by compressed natural gas (CNG) were examined using both chassis dynamometer and on-road testing. A portable on-board FTIR analyzer was used to measure concentrations of reactive nitrogen compounds – NO, NO2 and ammonia, of CO, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and greenhouse gases CO2, methane and N2O. Exhaust flow was inferred from engine control unit data. Total emissions per cycle were compared and found to be in good agreement with laboratory measurements of NOX, CO and CO2 during dynamometer tests. On diesel engines, mean NOX emissions were 136–1070 mg/km in the laboratory and 537–615 mg/km on the road, in many cases nearly an order of magnitude higher compared to the numerical value of the Euro 6 limit. Mean N2O emissions were 3–19 mg/km and were equivalent to several g/km CO2. The measurements suggest that NOX and N2O emissions from late-model European light utility vehicles with diesel engines are non-negligible and should be continuously assessed and scrutinized. High variances in NOX emissions among the tested diesel vehicles suggest that large number of vehicles should be tested to offer at least some insights about distribution of fleet emissions among vehicles. CNG engines exhibited relatively low emissions of NOX (12–186 mg/km) and NH3 (10–24 mg/km), while mean emissions of methane were 18–45 mg/km, under 1 g/km CO2 equivalent, and N2O, CO, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were negligible. The combination of a relatively clean-burning fuel, modern engine technology and a three-way catalyst has resulted in relatively low emissions under the wide variety of operating conditions encountered during the tests.

Red-light phenotype in a marine diatom involves a specialized oligomeric red-shifted antenna and altered cell morphology,"Diatoms greatly contribute to carbon fixation and thus strongly influence the global biogeochemical balance. Capable of chromatic acclimation (CA) to unfavourable light conditions, diatoms often dominate benthic ecosystems in addition to their planktonic lifestyle. Although CA has been studied at the molecular level, our understanding of this phenomenon remains incomplete. Here we provide new data to better explain the acclimation-associated changes under red-enhanced ambient light (RL) in diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, known to express a red-shifted antenna complex (F710). The complex was found to be an oligomer of a single polypeptide, Lhcf15. The steady-state spectroscopic properties of the oligomer were also studied. The oligomeric assembly of the Lhcf15 subunits is required for the complex to exhibit a red-shifted absorption. The presence of the red antenna in RL culture coincides with the development of a rounded phenotype of the diatom cell. A model summarizing the modulation of the photosynthetic apparatus during the acclimation response to light of different spectral quality is proposed. Our study suggests that toggling between alternative organizations of photosynthetic apparatus and distinct cell morphologies underlies the remarkable acclimation capacity of diatoms.",10610.0,"Herbstová, Miroslava:Bína, David:Kaňa, Radek:Vácha, František:Litvín, Radek",Scientific Reports,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Evaluation and selection of clustering methods using a hybrid group MCDM,"Due to the lack of objective measures, the evaluation and prioritization of clustering methods is inherently challenging. Since their evaluation generally involves numerous criteria, it can be designed as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem and using multiple data sets, the problem can be formulated as a group MCDM modeling. In this paper, a MCDM-based framework is proposed to evaluate and rank a number of clustering methods. The proposed approach employs three group MCDM algorithms and a Borda count method which leads to a comprehensive, robust framework capable of evaluating and ranking multiple clustering models on manifold data sets (cases). Moreover, we introduce a hybrid data clustering algorithm which combines a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with a K-means clustering algorithm. Finally, a clustering comparison with regard to both external and internal evaluation indicators is another contribution of this paper. Six clustering methods are compared based on five evaluation measures. The results of comparative experiments on ten data sets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid clustering method. More importantly, the experimental results vividly demonstrate the effectiveness of the group MCDM-based evaluation on clustering model selection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"Detection of stress anomaly produced by interaction of compressive fault steps in the West Bohemia swarm region, Czech Republic","Observations of the 2008-2014 seismic activity in West Bohemia, Czech Republic, provide evidence of interaction of compressive fault steps that created local stress anomaly and triggered a seismic sequence with exceptional properties. The West Bohemia is a geothermal area, characterized by persistent fluid-driven seismicity in the form of earthquake swarms. The focal zone is formed by two weak and fluid-eroded parallel strike-slip faults with a step of about 200m. The fault segments were activated successively by the 2008 and 2011 swarms with magnitudes of the strongest events of 3.8 and 3.7, respectively. In 2014, a fracture linking both segments was formed or activated by a mainshock-aftershock sequence. The aftershock decay was very fast, and the focal mechanism of the strongest event with magnitude of 4.2 was inconsistent with the regional background stress. The stress inversion of 957 focal mechanisms revealed a stress anomaly characterized by interchanging the sigma(2) and sigma(3) principal stress axes in the area of fault interaction. The modeling of the Coulomb stress change confirmed that the stress anomaly could completely disturb the regional background stress and produce the rotation of the principal stress axes retrieved from focal mechanisms. The faults activated or newly formed within the compressive stress anomaly were of high strength, which caused the anomalous mainshock-aftershock character of the 2014 activity and the rapid aftershock decay. Linking the two previously active isolated faults during the 2014 activity increased the expected moment magnitude M-w of a possible strongest earthquake from 5.0 to 5.4.",10507.0,"Vavryčuk, Václav:Adamová, Petra",Tectonics,2,high,high,1,0,medium,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The proposed modified concept of tourism carrying capacity approaches the protected area as a destination system where the continuous determination, estimation, and attainment of the visitation optimum are the main problems to be solved. The overall aim is to construct a comprehensive destination model which can be embedded into a decision-support system for visitor management. Testing of the proposed system, derived through an inductive process, has been initiated in the Czech Republic´s protected area, for which a comprehensive destination model is being created",50902.0,"Pásková, Martina:Wall, Geoffrey:Zejda, David:Zelenka, Josef","Journal of Destination Marketing &amp, Management",2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fractional covers and matchings in families of weighted d-intervals,"A d-interval is a union of at most d disjoint closed intervals on a fixed line. Tardos [Combinatorica 15 (1995), 123-134] and the second author [Disc. Comput.

Bioremediation of chlorophenol-contaminated sawmill soil using pilot-scale bioreactors under consecutive anaerobic-aerobic conditions,"Chlorophenols (CPs), including pentachlorophenol (PCP), are chemicals of concern due to their toxicity and persistence. Here we describe a successful reactor-based remediation of CP-contaminated soil and assess changes in the toxicity patterns and bacterial communities during the remediation. The remediation consisted of separating half of the contaminated soil to be ground (samples M) in order to test whether the grinding expedited the remediation, the other half was left unground (samples P). Both soils were mixed with wastewater treatment sludge to increase their bacterial diversity and facilitate the degradation of CPs, and the resultant mixtures were placed in 2 bioreactors, M and P, operated for 16 months under anaerobic conditions to favor dehalogenation and for an additional 16 months under aerobic conditions to achieve complete mineralization. Samples were taken every 4 months for toxicity and microbial analyses. The results showed a 64% removal of total CPs (Sigma CPs) in reactor P after just 18 months of remediation, whereas similar depletion in reactor M occurred after similar to 25 months, indicating that the grinding decelerated the remediation. By the end of the experiment, both reactors achieved 93.5 -95% removal. The toxicity tests showed a decrease in toxicity as the remediation progressed. The succession of bacterial communities over time was significantly associated with pH, anaerobic/aerobic phase and the concentration of the majority of CP congeners. Our data indicate that the supplementation of contaminated soil with sludge and further incubation in pilot-scale bioreactors under consecutive anaerobic-aerobic conditions proved to be effective at the remediation of CP-contaminated soil.",20801.0,"Lopez Echartea, Eglantina:Strejček, Michal:Matějů, Vít:Vosáhlová, Simona:Kyclt, Robin:Demnerová, Kateřina:Uhlík, Ondřej",Chemosphere,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Repertoire-based individual acoustic monitoring of a migratory passerine bird with complex song as an efficient tool for tracking territorial dynamics and annual return rates,"In field ecological and behavioural studies, it is often necessary to identify specific individuals. In birds, colour rings are frequently used to mark individuals, however, rings are often difficult to observe, especially in small species and dense habitats. Acoustic-based monitoring detecting individuals by their characteristic vocalization is a potentially suitable alternative, but this approach is challenging in species with complex songs. On the example of the Tree Pipit (Anthus trivialis), a small migratory passerine often singing in flight or from perches obscured by foliage, we demonstrate that acoustic monitoring based on the syllable repertoire can be very efficient tool for individual recognition. During a 3-year study, we obtained over 500 recordings from males from one study population (a number of them returning after winter). Males banded with colour rings were repeatedly recorded throughout the seasons, and syllable repertoires were determined from spectrograms for each recording. The repertoire of each unambiguously identified male was distinct and stable within as well as between seasons, and males with similar syllable repertoires differed in syntax. Based on the congruence between identification based solely on spectrogram assessment, and that based on observation of colour rings, we inferred that reliable identification of singing males (including non-ringed ones) was possible in the studied population from assessing a repertoire and song syntax of <5-min recording (containing 20-30 songs). The acoustic-based data: (i) increased the overall estimated number of territorial males at the study locality (from 49 ringed to 61), and improved the estimates of the period of their presence, (ii) revealed dynamic within-season changes in territory occupancy that would otherwise be missed, and (iii) allowed identification of returning birds (including non-ringed ones and those actively avoiding approaching humans).",0.0,"Petrusková, Tereza:Pišvejcová, Iveta:Kinštová, Anna:Brinke, Tomáš:Petrusek, Adam",Methods in Ecology and Evolution,2,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

However, the precise mechanism by which the transition-metal doping produces ferromagnetism has been controversial. Here we have studied a dilute magnetic semiconductor (5% manganese-doped gallium arsenide) with Bragg-reﬂection standing-wave hard X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and resolved its electronic structure into element- and momentum- resolved components. The measured valence band intensities have been projected into element-resolved components using analogous energy scans of Ga 3d, Mn 2 p, and As 3d core levels, with results in excellent agreement with element-projected Bloch spectral functions and clariﬁcation of the electronic structure of this prototypical material.

Mobility and attenuation of arsenic in sulfide-rich mining wastes from the Czech Republic,"The mineralogical composition of mining wastes deposited in countless dumps around the world is the key factor that controls retention and release of pollutants. Here we report a multi-method data set combining mineralogical (X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe and Raman microspectrometry) and geochemical (sequential extraction and pore water analysis) methods to resolve As mobility in two 50-years-old mining waste dumps. Originally, all of the As in the mining wastes selected for the study was present as arsenopyrite and with time it has been replaced by secondary As phases. At Jedová jáma mining area, the most of As precipitated as X-ray amorphous ferric arsenate (HFA). Arsenic is also accumulated in the scorodite and Fe (hydr)oxide (with up to 3.2 wt.% As2O5) that is particularly represented by hematite. Mining wastes at Dlouhá Ves contain only trace amount of scorodite. Arsenic is primarily bound to Pb-jarosite and Fe (hydr)oxides (especially goethite) with up to 1.6 and 1.8 wt.% As2O5, respectively. The pore water collected after rainfall events indicated high concentrations of As (~4600 μg.L-1) at Jedová jáma, whereas aqueous As at Dlouhá Ves was negligible (up to 1.5 μg.L-1). Highly mobile As at Jedová jáma is attributed to the dissolution of HFA and simultaneous precipitation of Fe (hydr)oxides under mildly acidic conditions (pH ~ 4.4), immobile As at Dlouhá Ves is due to the efficient adsorption on the Fe (hydr)oxides and hydroxosulfates under acidic pH of ~2.8. Taken together, As mobility in the ferric arsenates-containing mining wastes may significantly vary. These wastes must be kept under acidic conditions or with high aqueous Fe(III) concentrations to prevent the release of As from incongruent dissolution of ferric arsenates.",0.0,"Drahota, Petr:Knappová, Magdaléna:Kindlová, Helena:Culka, Adam:Majzlan, Juraj:Mihaljevič, Martin:Rohovec, Jan:Veselovsky, Frantisek:Fridrichova, Michaela:Jehlička, Jan",Science of the Total Environment,2,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0
Levinas on Temporality and the Other,"Levinas&apos,s account of time begins with the body&apos,s role in temporalization. This role privatizes time, making the time between different embodied subjects diachronic or nonsynchronizable. From this, he speaks of the temporality of our relation to the Other as infinite, that is, as a function of our not being able to synchronize ourselves with the Other, of our not being able to catch up with the Other, to grasp her completely in our relations with her. This provides him with a basis to describe the temporality of our sexual relations to the Other and the children produced. The result is a description of the infinity of time in terms of the succession of generations. The culminating point of Levinas&apos,s account is his treatment of the temporality of forgiveness. This is a forgiveness that, utilizing the generational renewal of embodied time, makes humanity capable of forgiving wrongs without forgetting them.",60301.0,"Mensch, James Richard",The Oxford Handbook of Levinas,2,medium,high,0,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Signatures of Exciton Delocalization and Exciton-Exciton Annihilation in Fluorescence-Detected Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy,"Incoherently detected coherent multidimensional spectroscopy is rapidly gaining popularity, promising a different application range and sensitivity than its traditional counterpart. While measuring the same response, the two methods are not equivalent. We present calculations of the fluorescence-detected coherent two-dimensional (F-2DES) spectra of a molecular heterodimer. We compare how the F-2DES technique differs from standard coherently detected two-dimensional (2DES) spectroscopy in measuring exciton delocalization. We analyze which processes contribute to cross-peaks in the zero-waiting-time spectra obtained by the two methods. Strictly on the basis of time-dependent perturbation theory, we study how in both methods the varying degree of cancellation between perturbative contributions gives rise to cross-peaks and we identify exciton annihilation and exciton relaxation contributions to the cross-peak in the zero-waiting-time F-2DES. We propose that time-gated fluorescence detection can be used to isolate the annihilation contribution to F-2DES both to retrieve information equivalent to 2DES spectroscopy and to study the annihilation contribution itself.",10301.0,"Malý, Pavel:Mančal, Tomáš",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,2,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Renal Hemodynamics in AKI: In Search of New Treatment Targets,"Novel therapeutic interventions are required to prevent or treat AKI. To expedite progress in this regard, a consensus conference held by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative was convened in April of 2014 to develop recommendations for research priorities and future directions. Here, we highlight the concepts related to renal hemodynamics in AKI that are likely to reveal new treatment targets on investigation. Overall, we must better understand the interactions between systemic, total renal, and glomerular hemodynamics, including the role of tubuloglomerular feedback. Furthermore, the net consequences of therapeutic maneuvers aimed at restoring glomerular filtration need to be examined in relation to the nature, magnitude, and duration of the insult. Additionally, microvascular blood flow heterogeneity in AKI is now recognized as a common occurrence, timely interventions to preserve the renal microcirculatory flow may interrupt the downward spiral of injury toward progressive kidney failure and should, therefore, be investigated. Finally, development of techniques that permit an integrative physiologic approach, including direct visualization of renal microvasculature and measurement of oxygen kinetics and mitochondrial function in intact tissue in all nephron segments, may provide new insights into how the kidney responds to various injurious stimuli and allow evaluation of new therapeutic strategies",0.0,"Matějovič, Martin:Ince, Can:Chawla, Lakhmir S.:Blantz, Roland:Molitoris, Bruce A.:Rosner, Mitchell H.:Okusa, Mark D.:Kellum, John A.:Ronco, Claudio",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2,high,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Body Schema Dynamics in Merleau-Ponty,"This chapter presents an account of Merleau-Ponty’s interpretation of the body schema as an operative intentionality that is not only opposed to, but also complexly intermingled with, the representation-like grasp of the world and one’s own body, or the body image. The chapter reconstructs Merleau-Ponty’s position primarily based on his preparatory notes for his 1953 lecture ‘The Sensible World and the World of Expression’. Here, Merleau-Ponty elaborates his earlier efforts to show that the body schema is a perceptual ground against which the perceived world stands out as a complex of perceptual figures. The chapter clarifies how Merleau-Ponty’s renewed interpretation of the figure-ground structure makes it possible for him to describe the relationship between body schema and perceptual (body) image as a strictly systematic phenomenon. Subsequently, the chapter shows how Merleau-Ponty understands apraxia, sleep, and perceptual orientation as examples of dedifferentiation and subtler differentiation of the body-schematic system. The last section clarifies how such body-schematic differentiating processes give rise to relatively independent superstructures of vision and symbolic cognition which constitute our body image. It, moreover, explains how, according to Merleau-Ponty, the cognitive superstructures always need to be supported by praxic operative intentionality to maintain their full sense, even though, in some cases, they have the power to compensate for praxic deficiencies.",60301.0,"Halák, Jan",Body Schema and Body Image: New Perspectives,2,low,high,0,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cerebellar parcellation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,"Objective: The cerebellum is involved in cognitive processing and emotion control. Cerebellar alterations could explain symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, literature suggests that lithium might influence cerebellar anatomy.

We included 182 patients with SZ, 144 patients with BD and 322 controls. We automatically segmented the cerebellum using the CERES pipeline. All outputs were visually inspected. RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia SZ showed a smaller global cerebellar grey matter volume compared to controls, with most of the changes located to the cognitive part of the cerebellum (Crus II and lobule VIIb). This decrease was present in the subgroup of patients with recent-onset SZ. We did not find any alterations in the cerebellum in patients with BD.

Post-syntactic mechanisms of pronominal case variation in Germanic,"Pronoun-case-only (pro-case) languages in Germanic have been under-investigated, despite exhibiting theoretically significant patterns of inter- and intra-individual case variation. The goals of this paper are thus twofold. First, it establishes a pro-case typological distinction between Oblique-Form Default (OFD) as observed in Danish and English, and Subject-Form Default (SFD), as observed in Swedish. In OFD varieties, SFs (Subject Forms) occur as subjects of finite clauses, while OFs (Oblique Forms) occur elsewhere, including as predicatives and in heterogenous other syntactic environments. OFs also appear inside coordinate and other complex DPs, where sociolinguistic variation is attested. In SFD varieties, variation inside complex DPs is unattested, SFs occur as predicatives, but variable OFs express non-deictic semantics. My second aim is to demonstrate that these patterns of variation result from distinct post-syntactic mechanisms for OFD and SFD pro-case. Following Emonds, I argue that OFD pronouns are not the phonological realization of case features, instead, pro-case forms are morphosyntactic-contextual allomorphs. SFD pro-case, in contrast, is the phonological realization of dependent Oblique and Nominative features assigned by post-syntactic rules.",60203.0,"Parrott, Jeffrey Keith",Acta Linguistica Hafniensia,2,medium,high,0,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Physics and applications of charged domain walls,"The charged domain wall is an ultrathin (typically nanosized) interface between two domains it carries bound charge owing to a change of normal component of spontaneous polarization on crossing the wall. In contrast to hetero-interfaces between different materials, charged domain walls (CDWs) can be created, displaced, erased, and recreated again in the bulk of a material. Screening of the bound charge with free carriers is often necessary for stability of CDWs, which can result in giant two-dimensional conductivity along the wall. Usually in nominally insulating ferroelectrics, the concentration of free carriers at the walls can approach metallic values. Thus, CDWs can be viewed as ultrathin reconfigurable strongly conductive sheets embedded into the bulk of an insulating material. The present review is aiming at a concise presentation of the main physical ideas behind CDWs and a brief overview of the most important theoretical and experimental findings in the field.",10302.0,"Bednyakov, Petr:Sturman, B.I.:Sluka, T.:Tagantsev, A.K.:Yudin, Petr",NPJ Computational,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Geochemistry of impact glasses and target rocks from the Zhamanshin impact structure, Kazakhstan: Implications for mixing of target and impactor matter","Internal structure and element chemistry including contents of highly siderophile elements (HSE) and Os isotope ratios have been studied in target rocks and several groups of impact glasses of the Zhamanshin impact structure, Kazakhstan. These include larger irregularly-shaped fragments and blocks of impact glass (zhamanshinites), and three types of tektite-like splash-form glasses, part of fallback ejecta. They can be subdivided into acidic types (irghizites, typically 69–76 wt.% SiO2), basic splash-forms (typically 53–56 wt.% SiO2), and rarely occurring highly inhomogeneous composites with abundant mineral inclusions. A comparison with the target rocks shows that zhamanshinites and basic splash-forms usually have no detectable admixture of the projectile matter. In contrast, irghizites exhibit clear admixture of the projectile matter, which was incorporated by complex processes accompanied by strong element fractionations. Microscopic investigations confirm that irghizites were formed mainly by coalescence of smaller molten glass droplets sized typically below 1 mm. Irghizites exhibit significant enrichments in Ni, Co and Cr, whose concentrations are locally elevated in the rims of the original small droplets. A portion of these elements and also part of Fe and Mn and other elements were derived from the impactor, most likely a Ni-rich carbonaceous chondrite.  The observed structural and microchemical features of irghizites are interpreted to reflect variable proportions of the uppermost target sediments and the projectile matter, with HSE element ratios influenced by evaporation and condensation processes, and differences in volatility of individual HSE elements and/or their compounds. Two possible pathways of incorporation of the projectile matter into the irghizites include either re-condensation of evaporated projectile matter on the surface of glass droplets, or incorporation of less chemically fractionated microparticles dispersed by the explosion.",0.0,"Jonášová, Šárka:Ackerman, Lukáš:Žák, Karel:Skála, Roman:Ďurišová, Jana:Deutsch, A.:Magna, T.",Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Young-of-the-year fish as a prospective bioindicator for aquatic environmental contamination monitoring,"Toxic metals (Hg, Cd, Pb) and fifteen perfiuoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were determined in different fish samples at two locations on the Elbe River in the Czech Republic. The muscle tissue of the two adult fish species most commonly used as bioindicators in central Europe and whole body homogenates of various species of young-of-the-year (YOY) fish were used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential to replace adult fish muscle tissue with YOY fish for contamination monitoring. All of the toxic metals and five of the fifteen PFASs were found in the YOY fish samples while only mercury and PFOS were detected in the muscle tissue of adults. The concentration of total mercury (THg) in the YOY fish homogenates ranged between 0.014 and 0.062 mu g g(-1). Of the spectrum of analysed pollutants, only the THg concentrations were lower in YOY fish homogenates than in adult muscle tissue. The cadmium concentration varied from 0.004 to 0.024 mu g g(-1) and the lead concentration varied from 0.032 to 0.396 mu g g(-1) in YOY fish homogenates, while in most of the adult samples, Cd and Pb were below the detection limit of the analytical methods employed. The PFOS concentrations in YOY fish homogenates were comparable to the concentrations frequently found in adult liver tissue.

Stable regularities without governing laws?,"Can stable regularities be explained without appealing to governing laws or any other modal notion? In this paper, I consider what I will call a “Humean system”-a generic dynamical system without guiding laws-and assess whether it could display stable regularities. First, I present what can be interpreted as an account of the rise of stable regularities, following from Strevens (2003), which has been applied to explain the patterns of complex systems (such as those from meteorology and statistical mechanics). Second, since this account presupposes that the underlying dynamics displays deterministic chaos, I assess whether it can be adapted to cases where the underlying dynamics is not chaotic but truly random-that is, cases where there is no dynamics guiding the time evolution of the system. If this is so, the resulting stable, apparently non-accidental regularities are the fruit of what can be called statistical necessity rather than of a primitive physical necessity.",60301.0,"Filomeno, Aldo",Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics,2,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
White dwarfs and revelations,"We use the most recent, complete and independent measurements of masses and radii of white dwarfs in binaries to bound the class of non-trivial modified gravity theories, viable after GW170817/GRB170817, using its effect on the mass-radius relation of the stars. We show that the uncertainty in the latest data is sufficiently small that residual evolutionary effects, most notably the effect of core composition, finite temperature and envelope structure, must now accounted for if correct conclusions about the nature of gravity are to be made. We model corrections resulting from finite temperature and envelopes to a base Hamada-Salpeter cold equation of state and derive consistent bounds on the possible modifications of gravity in the stars' interiors, finding that the parameter quantifying the strength of the modification Y< 0.14 at 95% confidence, an improvement of a factor of three with respect to previous bounds.",10308.0,"Saltas, Ippocratis:Sawicki, Ignacy:Lopes, I.",Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The abnormal status of uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein species represents an additional mortality risk in heart failure patients with vascular disease,"Background: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a natural inhibitor of tissue calcification. In a previous study, we observed the positive association between abnormal concentrations of uncarboxylatedMGP species and increased mortality risk in stable vascular patients. We explore whether co-incidence of abnormal status of uncarboxylated MPG and heart failure (HF) affects the mortality risk. Methods: We examined 799 patients (mean age 65.1 years) with stable vascular disease and followed them in a prospective study. Both, desphospho-uncarboxylated and total uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP or t-ucMGP) were quantified by pre-commercial ELISA assays. Results: Elevated (>100 ng/L) circulating brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and abnormal status of plasma uncarboxylated MGP species (i.e.: dp-ucMGP }= 977 pmol/L or t-ucMGP {= 2825 nmol/L) were all identified as robust predictors of all-cause 5-year mortality. However, their co-incidence represented a substantial additional risk. We observed the highest mortality risk in patients with elevated BNP plus high dp-ucMGP compared to those with normal BNP plus low dp-ucMGP, fully adjusted HRR's were 4.86 (3.15-7.49). Likewise, the risk was increased when compared with patients with elevated BNP plus low dp-ucMGP, HRR 2.57 (1.60-4.10). Similar result we observed when co-incidence of elevated BNP and low t-ucMGP was analyzed [corresponding HRR's were 4.16 (2.62-6.61) and 1.96 (1.24-3.12)]. Conclusions: The concomitant abnormality of uncarboxylatedMGP and mild elevation of BNP leads in chronic patients with vascular disease to about two-fold increase of the relative mortality risk.

The Radical Right in Post-Soviet Ukraine,"During much of Ukraine’s post-Soviet history, the radical right has remained on the political periphery, wielding little influence over national politics. However, from 2009 to 2014, Ukraine saw a radical right-wing party, Svoboda, enter parliament, and from 2014 to 2016 there was an increased social role played by the right-wing radical groups Pravyi Sektor and Azov. Thus, the political impact of the far right in Ukraine extends beyond electoral performance and to the activities of extra-parliamentary groups that are beginning to penetrate political life and state institutions. The radical right in Ukraine is intertwined, but not identical, with ethnic Ukrainian nationalism. The direction and development of the Ukrainian far right have thus been a result of both the historical legacy and cultural context of a nation that was ruled over by others for centuries and is home to competing ethnic nationalisms and geopolitical orientations.",50601.0,"Mierzejewski-Voznyak, Melanie",The Oxford Handbook of the Radical Right,2,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The early dendritic cell signaling induced by virulent Francisella tularensis strain occurs in phases and involves the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 In the later stage,"Dendritic cells (DCs) infected by Francisella tularensis are poorly activated and do not undergo classical maturation process. Although reasons of such unresponsiveness are not fully understood, their impact on the priming of immunity is well appreciated. Previous attempts to explain the behavior of Francisella-infected DCs were hypothesis-driven and focused on events at later stages of infection. Here, we took an alternative unbiased approach by applying methods of global phosphoproteomics to analyze the dynamics of cell signaling in primary DCs during the first hour of infection by Francisella tularensis. Presented results show that the early response of DCs to Francisella occurs in phases and that ERK and p38 signaling modules induced at the later stage are differentially regulated by virulent and attenuated Delta dsbA strain.

A companion to the archaeological sources of Roman military interventions into the Germanic territory north of the Danube during the Marcomannic Wars,"Roman-Barbarian contacts are a special phenomenon and enjoy a long tradition in various fields of archaeological research on the Roman Period in the Middle Danube region. One of the most interesting forms of these relations, which vary in type and intensity considerably, are traces of military confrontations dating into the period of the Marcomannic wars. Next to the known sites with evidence of Roman military presence in Mušov-Burgstall and Iža, our knowledge of spatial deployment, dynamics and structure of Roman military offensive forces on Germanic territory is primarily based on the research of the so-called temporary camps. Duringnthe last decades, our state of knowledge in this field of research has improved considerably through the discovery of numerous new temporary camps of the Roman army as well as through the compilation of all available information on this research topic. It was the aim of an international research project, among other things, to determine the topographical location of the temporary camps, their chronological classification and period of use as exactly as possible. In a second step, an attempt was made to define their role within the overall geostrategic concept of the Roman offensive forces. At present, we register 16 localities within the Marcomannic settlement zone west of the Little Carpathians, where it has so far been possible to distinguish or reconstruct a total of 26 separate temporarynmilitary camps or their phases. East of the Little Carpathians, in the settlement area of the Quades, we now know 6 sites with 20 identified fortifications.

Seizure threshold manipulation in electroconvulsive therapy via repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. A novel way of augmentation?,"Introduction: A high seizure threshold (ST) is an impeding factor in certain patients, potentially preventing a successful electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment. Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods have been put forward to augment ECT in such patients, however, to this date, only a handful of case reports existed about the potential role of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), as an augmentation method. Objectives: and Methods: In this randomized, double-blinded, sham controlled study, we set out to test the hypothesis of whether the application of high frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF rTMS) lowers the seizure threshold for electroconvulsive therapy and whether it has an effect on other aspects of ECT treatment, such as seizure duration (SD), efficacy and safety. Results: 46 patients treated for a major depressive episode, indicated for ECT, were recruited to this study. A significantly lower seizure threshold was observed in the experimental group during ECT titration, on average a decrease by 34.55%, from 34.23 mC to 22.4 mC, p &lt, 0.001 (Wilcox test). We had not observed a significant effect of TMS stimulation before ECT on seizure duration or clinical outcome. Another potentially important observation of this study is that 4 patients in the experimental group developed transient symptoms of hypomania/mania, all of which were stabilized after the combined stimulation protocol was halted spontaneously within a week, without the need to administer mood stabilizers. Conclusion: It is likely that HF rTMS stimulation prior to ECT is a novel and simple way of reducing the ST, which is useful in certain groups of patients undergoing this important treatment modality.

Physical stability of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose-based amorphous solid dispersions: Experimental and computational study,"The preparation of an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) is a promising strategy for improving the poor oral bioavailability of many active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, poor predictability of ASD long-term physical stability remains a prevalent problem. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the predictive performance of selected models concerning solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) curve and glass-transition temperature (T-g) line modeling of ibuprofen (IBU) in cellulosic polymers (i.e., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)). For SLE curve modeling, an empirical analytical approach (Kyeremateng et al., 2014) and the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state (EOS) were chosen. Due to the unavailability of PC-SAFT parameters for both polymers, an approximation procedure for parametrization was applied. The Gordon-Taylor equation and Kwei equation were considered for T-g line determination. The impact of various computational set-ups (e.g., model parametrization or extrapolation length) on IBU solubility prediction at storage conditions was thoroughly investigated, assessed and confronted with the results from an 18-month physical stability study. IBU developed stable 20 wt% API content ASDs with both HPMC and HPMCAS. The extrapolation behavior and subsequent ASD thermodynamic stability prediction at storage conditions deduced from the aforementioned models were significantly different. Overall, the PC-SAFT EOS predicted higher IBU solubility in both polymers and, thus, a lower recrystallization tendency when compared to the empirical analytical approach. At higher IBU concentrations, liquid-liquid demixing in IBU-polymer systems was predicted by the PC-SAFT EOS, which was in qualitative disagreement with experimental observation.",10403.0,"Iemtsev, Anton:Hassouna, Fatima:Mathers, Alex:Klajmon, Martin:Dendisová, Marcela:Malinová, Lenka:Školáková, Tereza:Fulem, Michal",International Journal of Pharmaceutics,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Settlement activity in later prehistory: invisible in the archaeological record but documented by pollen and sedimentary evidence,"The paper deals with landscape and settlement development between ca. 300 BC and AD 600 in a defined area of the northern Czech Republic. Despite favourable natural conditions, human occupation of the area did not begin until the end of the first millennium BC. Natural soil and vegetation development therefore lasted longer than in the traditionally settled lowland areas. Initial settlement activity from the La Tène period caused substantial erosion of deforested luvisols and retisols, well-documented by an accumulation of eroded soil horizons in a local wetland. The erosion process continued for more than 500 years following the end of the La Tène settlement, despite the fact that archaeological research revealed no reliable evidence of occupation prior to the twelfth century AD. Pollen and sedimentary records from the wetland, however, clearly indicate the existence of settlement activity during the “archaeologically invisible” Roman and Migration periods. This case is not unique and underlines the importance of environmental analysis for the detection of settlement history, particularly during periods of poor archaeological visibility or in places that are difficult to research using standard archaeological methods. The change in conditions after the first deforestation and subsequent late prehistoric settlement triggered the degradation of the deforested luvisols and retisols and led to the diversification of the soil cover, which now also includes regosols, gleysols, and truncated luvisols and retisols.",60102.0,"Dreslerová, Dagmar:Kozáková, Radka:Chuman, T.:Strouhalová, Barbora:Abraham, V.:Poništiak, Š.:Šefrna, L.",Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences,2,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Consequently, reverb became the main tool to explore the subject in practice. Due to the project’s multidisciplinarity, the subject had different approaches: from the possibility of reverb as a tool for fiction-making, to listener’s comprehensibility and readability of the events, exploring spatialization techniques and multichannel reproduction systems to finally conclude with the idea that, in the end, sound relies on the listener’s actual physical experience of the space.",60500.0,"Da Silva Pinheiro, Sara Patrícia:Šenkyřík, Matěj:Rouš, Jiří:Zábrodský, Petr",Digital Creativity,2,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Rheological properties and microstructure of binary waste red brick powder /metakaolin geopolymer,"Waste brick powder is a material with sufficient pozzolanic properties to be used as a supplementary cementing material in Portland cement-based concrete or as a precursor for the production of geopolymers. This study aimed to investigate a binary geopolymer system composed of metakaolin (MK), waste red brick (WRB) powder and sodium silicate solution as an alkaline activator. Five different mixtures were prepared where 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the MK was substituted with WRB. The rheological parameters of the fresh pastes were correlated with a structural evaluation of the reaction process. The findings showed that the yield stress of all mixtures was very low, but it increased with time as the geopolymerization reaction proceeded. The more MK was used in the mixture, the faster the yield stress developed. On the other hand, the plastic viscosity strongly depended on the composition of the mixtures and dropped with increasing WRB/MK ratio. The mixtures containing more than 50% MK exhibited a decrease in viscosity with time due to higher reactivity and the faster dissolution of the MK particles.",20101.0,"Rovnaník, Pavel:Rovnaníková, Pavla:Vyšvařil, Martin:Grzeszczyk, Stefania:Janowska-Renkas, Elizbieta",Construction and building materials,2,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Towards operando computational modeling in heterogeneous catalysis,"An increased synergy between experimental and theoretical investigations in heterogeneous catalysis has become apparent during the last decade. Experimental work has extended from ultra-high vacuum and low temperature towards operando conditions. These developments have motivated the computational community to move from standard descriptive computational models, based on inspection of the potential energy surface at 0 K and low reactant concentrations (0 K/UHV model), to more realistic conditions. The transition from 0 K/UHV to operando models has been backed by significant developments in computer hardware and software over the past few decades. New methodological developments, designed to overcome part of the gap between 0 K/UHV and operando conditions, include (i) global optimization techniques, (ii) ab initio constrained thermodynamics, (iii) biased molecular dynamics, (iv) microkinetic models of reaction networks and (v) machine learning approaches. The importance of the transition is highlighted by discussing how the molecular level picture of catalytic sites and the associated reaction mechanisms changes when the chemical environment, pressure and temperature effects are correctly accounted for in molecular simulations.

Microscopic nature of the first-order field-induced phase transition in the strongly anisotropic ferrimagnet HoFe5Al7,"We report on x-ray magnetic circular dichroism experiments in pulsed fields up to 30 T to follow the rotations of individual magnetic moments through the field-induced phase transition in the ferrimagnet HoFe5Al7. Near the ground state, we observe simultaneous stepwise rotations of the Ho and Fe moments and explain them using a two-sublattice model for an anisotropic ferrimagnet with weak intersublattice exchange interactions. Near the compensation point, we find two phase transitions.

"Tracking, Behavior and Fate of 58 Pesticides Originated from Hops during Beer Brewing","The study presents tracking of 58 pesticide residues associated with hops to estimate their carryover into brewed beer. The pesticides were spiked onto organic hops at a concentration of 15 mg/kg, and the wort was boiled with the artificially contaminated hops and fermented on a laboratory scale. Samples were collected during the whole brewing process and pesticide residues were extracted using a method known as QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe). An HPLC-HR-MS/MS method was developed and validated to identify and quantitate pesticide residues in treated hops, spent hops, hopped wort, green beer, and beer samples. Quantitation was achieved using standard addition with isotopically labeled standards. The carryover percentages into hopped wort and the percentages of decay reduction relative to the amount spiked on hops were calculated. The relationship between the partition coefficients n-octanol–water (log P values) and the residual ratios (RW and RB) of a pesticide were evaluated to predict their behavior during hopping of wort and fermentation. Pesticides with a high log P values (>3.75) tended to remain in spent hops. The pesticides that have a low log P value up to approximately 3 could represent the demarcation lines of appreciable transfer rate of pesticides from hops to beer. Consequently, the pesticides were divided into three categories depending upon their fate during the brewing process. The most potential risk category represents a group involving the thermostable pesticides, such as azoxystrobin, boscalid, dimethomorph, flonicamid, imidacloprid, mandipropamid, myclobutanil, and thiamethoxam, which were transferred at high rates from the pesticide enriched hops into beer during the laboratory brewing trial. These results can be used as a guideline in the application of pesticides on hop plants that would reduce the level of pesticide residues in beer and their exposure in humans.",10406.0,"Dušek, Martin:Olšovská, Jana:Jandovská, Vladimíra",Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

These images range from examples of shared ownership and practices to situations where different parties vied for control and ownership. The narratives contained in these sources, written predominantly by European authors for a European readership, strive to confirm the Jewish identity of the sacred sites in the Holy Land and Babylonia and the Jews&apos, rights of ownership to them. They not only reverse the relationship between the ruler and the ruled but, at the same time, they convey the message that the real owners of the holy places connected with the narratives of the Hebrew Bible and Jewish history, and ipso facto of the true religion, are the Jews.

Low-fouling surface plasmon resonance biosensor for multi-step detection of foodborne bacterial pathogens in complex food samples,"Recent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have shown that foodborne bacterial pathogens present a significant threat to public health, resulting in an increased need for technologies capable of fast and reliable screening of food commodities. The optimal method of pathogen detection in foods should: (i) be rapid, specific, and sensitive, (ii) require minimum sample preparation, and (iii) be robust and cost-effective, thus enabling use in the field. Here we report the use of a SPR biosensor based on ultra-low fouling and functionalizable poly(carboxybetaine acrylamide) (pCBAA) brushes for the rapid and sensitive detection of bacterial pathogens in crude food samples utilizing a three-step detection assay. We studied both the surface resistance to fouling and the functional capabilities of these brushes with respect to each step of the assay, namely: (I) incubation of the sensor with crude food samples, resulting in the capture of bacteria by antibodies immobilized to the pCBAA coating, (II) binding of secondary biotinylated antibody (Ab(2)) to previously captured bacteria, and (III) binding of streptavidin-coated gold nanoparticles to the biotinylated Ab(2) in order to enhance the sensor response. We also investigated the effects of the brush thickness on the biorecognition capabilities of the gold-grafted functionalized pCBAA coatings. We demonstrate that pCBAA-compared to standard low-fouling OEG-based alkanethiolate self-assemabled monolayers-exhibits superior surface resistance regarding both fouling from complex food samples as well as the non-specific binding of S-AuNPs. We further demonstrate that a SPR biosensor based on a pCBAA brush with a thickness as low as 20 nm was capable of detecting E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella sp. in complex hamburger and cucumber samples with extraordinary sensitivity and specificity.",0.0,"Vaisocherová-Lísalová, Hana:Víšová, Ivana:Ermini, Maria Laura:Špringer, Tomáš:Chadtová Song, Xue:Mrázek, Jan:Lamačová, Josefína:Lynn, Nicholas Scott:Šedivák, P.:Homola, Jiří",Biosensors and Bioelectronics,2,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Surface modification of Norway spruce wood by octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) nanosol by dipping and water vapour diffusion properties of the OTS-modified wood,"The present research deals with a simple dipping method to insert octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) into cell walls of spruce wood and to deposit OTS layers on its inner and outer surfaces.

Permanent Percutaneous Carotid Artery Filter to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients The CAPTURE Trial,"BACKGROUND Patients with high stroke risk and atrial fibrillation who are unsuitable to oral anticoagulants (OACs) require other stroke prevention strategies. A novel permanent coil filter directly placed into both common carotid arteries (CCAs) was designed to capture emboli >1.4 mm in diameter. OBJECTIVES The multicenter, nonrandomized, first-in-human clinical CAPTURE (Carotid Artery Implant for Trapping Upstream Emboli for Preventing Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients) trial sought to determine the feasibility and safety of bilateral CCA filter placement. METHODS Eligible patients had atrial fibrillation, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75 years, Diabetes, Stroke/transient ischemic attack, Vascular disease, Age 65 to 74 years, Sex category) >= 2, OAC unsuitability, CCA size 4.8 to 9.8 mm, and no carotid stenosis > 30%. Under ultrasound guidance, after direct transcutaneous carotid puncture with a 24-gauge needle, a motorized unit expels the filter to unfurl in the artery. Patients received aspirin/clopidogrel for 3 months, and aspirin thereafter. Primary endpoints were: 1) procedural success-bilateral, properly positioned CCA filters, and 2) 30-day incidence of major adverse events-death, stroke, major bleeding, filter migration, CCA thrombus, or stenosis. Carotid ultrasounds were conducted post-procedure, pre-discharge, at 1 week, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS At 3 centers, 25 patients were enrolled: age 71 +/- 9 years, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc = 4.4 +/- 1.0, prior embolism in 48%. Procedure success was 92% (23 of 25 patients), 1 patient had unilateral deployment. There were no device/procedurerelated major adverse events, minor puncture site hematomas/edema occurred in 5 of 25 (20%). After 6-month mean follow-up, asymptomatic thrombi were detected in 4 patients (1 bilateral, 4 unilateral), adjudicated as captured (n = 3), unclassified (n = 2), or in situ (n = 0). In all patients, the thrombi dissolved with subcutaneous heparin. In 1 patient, 2 device/procedure-unrelated minor strokes occurred. CONCLUSIONS Permanent carotid filter placement for stroke prophylaxis is technically feasible and safe.

Rapid approach for the determination of alcoholic strength and overall quality check of various spirit drinks and wines using GC-MS,"In this study, we have developed a simple, high throughput method applicable for determination of alcoholic strength by volume in spirit drinks and wines, only small sample volume (50 mu I) is required for the analysis. Gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) is employed for this purpose. While split sample injection is used in analysis of most spirits, headspace solid phase sampling of volatiles by solid phase micro extraction (HS-SPME) has to be used for analysis of more complex samples such as egg liqueur or port wine. Quantification of ethanol is performed by isotopic dilution using 2,2,2-trideuterioethanol as an internal standard. The method validation was carried out on five various categories of distilled spirit drinks represented by vodka, whisky, pear brandy, grappa and rum (differing in a content of other commonly controlled volatiles such as acetaldehyde, methanol, ethyl acetate and fusel alcohols), three wines, port wine and egg liqueur. The repeatability of determined alcoholic strength expressed as a relative standard deviation ranged for tested samples from 0.19 to 0.98%, the trueness of results was successfully verified within the proficiency testing programme FAPAS (R) In addition, using this newly developed method, denaturants such as propan-2-ol, 2-methylpropan-2-ol and/or methanol can be screened.",40101.0,"Stupák, Michal:Kocourek, Vladimír:Kolouchová, Irena:Hajšlová, Jana",Food control,2,low,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Between Medicine and Politics: Oswald Croll's Activity in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown,"Oswald Croll (ca. 1560 - 1 November 1608), a physician, alchemist, philosopher, and diplomat, was undoubtedly one of the most important European humanist scholars at the turn of the 17th century. Croll's main contribution is his laying of the foundations for the new ""science""- medicinal alchemy-which he introduced in his largest published work, Basilica chymica (Frankfurt, ca. 1609). However, his activities were not restricted solely to scientific research. One of the significant stages of his life consisted of engaging in diplomatic activities in the service of the governor of Upper Palatinate, Christian of Anhalt. These activities led to the political unification of Protestants of the Holy Roman Empire, known as the Protestant Union.

Fremen: Frequency map enhancement for long-term mobile robot autonomy in changing environments,"We  present  a  new  approach  to  long-term  mobile robot  mapping  in  dynamic  indoor  environments.  Unlike  traditional  world  models  that  are  tailored  to  represent  static  scenes, our  approach  explicitly  models  environmental  dynamics.  We assume that some of the hidden processes that influence the dynamic environment states are periodic and model the uncertainty of  the  estimated  state  variables  by  their  frequency  spectra.  The spectral model can represent arbitrary timescales of environment dynamics with low memory requirements. Transformation of the spectral model to the time domain allows for the prediction of the future environment states, which improves the robot’s long-term performance  in  dynamic  environments.  Experiments  performed over  time  periods  of  months  to  years  demonstrate  that  the approach can efficiently represent large numbers of observations and reliably predict future environment states.

Gene Expression Pattern and Protein Localization of Arabidopsis Phospholipase D Alpha 1 Revealed by Advanced Light-Sheet and Super-Resolution Microscopy,"Phospholipase D alpha 1 (PLD alpha 1, At3g15730) and its product phosphatidic acid (PA) are involved in a variety of cellular and physiological processes, such as cytoskeletal remodeling, regulation of stomatal closure and opening, as well as biotic and abiotic stress signaling. Here we aimed to study developmental expression patterns and subcellular localization of PLD alpha 1 in Arabidopsis using advanced microscopy methods such as light-sheet fluorescencemicroscopy (LSFM) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). We complemented two knockout pld alpha 1 mutants with a YFP-tagged PLD alpha 1 expressed under the PLD alpha 1 native promoter in order to study developmental expression pattern and subcellular localization of PLD alpha 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana under natural conditions. Imaging of tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated localization of YFP-tagged PLD alpha 1 by LSFM in roots of growing seedlings showed accumulation of PLD alpha 1-YFP in the root cap and the rhizodermis. Expression of PLD alpha 1-YFP in the rhizodermis was considerably higher in trichoblasts before and during root hair formation and growth. Thus, PLD alpha 1-YFP accumulated in emerging root hairs and in the tips of growing root hairs. PLD alpha 1-YFP showed cytoplasmic subcellular localization in root cap cells and in cells of the root transition zone. In aerial parts of plants PLD alpha 1-YFP was also localized in the cytoplasm showing enhanced accumulation in the cortical cytoplasmic layer of epidermal non-dividing cells of hypocotyls, leaves, and leaf petioles. However, in dividing cells of root apical meristem and leaf petiole epidermis PLD alpha 1-YFP was enriched in mitotic spindles and phragmoplasts, as revealed by co-visualization with microtubules. Finally, super-resolution SIM imaging revealed association of PLD alpha 1-YFP with both microtubules and clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and pits (CCPs).

Individual stability in vocalization rates of preweaning piglets,"Piglet vocalization rates are used as welfare indicators. The emission rates of the two gross categories of piglet calls, namely low frequency calls (“grunts”) and high frequency calls (“screams”), may contain different information about the piglet’s internal state due to differing communicative functions of the two call types. More knowledge is needed about the sources of variation in calling rates within and between piglets. We examined to what extent the emission rates of the two call types are codetermined by individual and litter identity, i.e., whether the rates are repeatable within individuals and similar between littermates. We recorded frequency of grunts and screams in one mildly negative (shortterm Isolation) and one moderately negative (manual Restraint) situation during the first week (week 1) and the 4th week (week 4) of life and asked the following questions: 1) Are within-individual vocalization rates stable across the suckling period? 2) Are within-individual vocalization rates stable across the two situations? 3) Is there within-litter similarity in vocalization rates? 4) Does this within-litter similarity increase during the suckling period? Within-individual vocalization rates were stable between week 1 and week 4 (grunts in Restraint P < 0.05, grunts in Isolation P < 0.001, screams in Restraint P < 0.001, screams in Isolation P < 0.001). Across the two situations at the same age, the vocalization rates were not stable for grunts but were stable for screams at week 1 and week 4 (P < 0.05). Vocalization rates were more similar between littermates than between piglets belonging to different litters (grunts in Restraint P < 0.001, grunts in Isolation P < 0.01, screams in Restraint P < 0.001, screams in Isolation P < 0.001). This litter effect did not grow stronger from week 1 to week 4 as the within-litter coefficient of variance did not decrease between the two ages. Sex of the piglet had no influence on vocalization rates while greater body weight was associated with lower screaming rates in the Restraint situation (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that both individuality of the piglet and litter identity affect the vocalization rates of piglets in negatively valenced situations. For screams, the repeatability of individual vocalization rates holds even across situations, while for grunts, the rates are repeatable during ontogeny within the situations, but not across situations.",40201.0,"Špinka, Marek:Syrová, Michaela:Policht, Richard:Linhart, Pavel",Journal of Animal Science,2,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

Second, an argument is presented against the view that readers abstract their personal concerns away in reading, and that they do so with benefit. Third, the chapter shows how the reading consciousness encompasses rather than excludes the physical situation and environment of reading. For each idea revisited, the chapter discusses practical implications for how reading could be taught, assessed, and staged in educational settings.",60205.0,"Kuzmičová, Anežka",Further Reading,2,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The capacitance and electron transfer of 3D-printed graphene electrodes are dramatically influenced by the type of solvent used for pre-treatment,"3D-printing (or additive manufacturing) is presently an emerging technology that promises to reshape traditional manufacturing processes. The electrochemistry field can certainly take advantage of this fabrication tool for sensing and energy-related applications. Polymer/graphene filaments commonly used for the fabrication of 3D-printed electrodes show poor electrochemistry in the native state, requiring post-fabrication activation procedures. In the present work, solvent activation of graphene/polymer-based 3D-printed electrodes was investigated, using both polar aprotic solvents (DMF and acetone) and polar protic solvents (EtOH, MeOH, and H2O). Differences were noted with respect to the weight loss and surface morphologies of the activated electrodes prior to their use, depending the solvent used. The electrodes activated in polar aprotic solvents exhibit a dramatic increase in heterogeneous electron transfer rate using the Fe(CN6)(4-/3-) redox couple. Moreover, the activation medium has a crucial influence on the electrochemical double layer. We wish to provide meaningful insight to researchers by comparing results obtained with 3D-printed electrodes fabricated from graphene/polymer filaments and drawing attention to the influence of the solvents used in their activation.",10403.0,"Gusmão, Rui:Browne, Michelle P.:Sofer, Zdeněk:Pumera, Martin",ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS,2,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Evidence for light-by-light scattering in heavy-ion collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC,"Light-by-light scattering (gamma gamma -&gt, gamma gamma) is a quantum-mechanical process that is forbidden in the classical theory of electrodynamics. This reaction is accessible at the Large Hadron Collider thanks to the large electromagnetic field strengths generated by ultra-relativistic colliding lead ions. Using 480 mu b(-1) of lead-lead collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV by the ATLAS detector, here we report evidence for light-by-light scattering.

"Large landslide stress states calculated during extreme climatic and tectonic events on El Hierro, Canary Islands","Composed volcanic edifices are particularly prone to large-scale failures—these often result from the acceleration of preexisting deep-seated gravitational slope deformations. Consequently, a complete understanding of the kinematic behaviour of such slope deformations would represent an important step towards mitigating against human casualties or fatalities and damage to critical infrastructure. In this manuscript, a 9-month time series of three-dimensional fault displacement measurements has been used to determine the stress states of the San Andrés Landslide on El Hierro in the Canary Islands. These stress states have been calculated on the basis of single-displacement events using a novel approach which only requires information about the magnitude of the movement vector and its orientation. The analysis focused on four specific periods: a reference period in November 2013, an extreme rainfall event at the beginning of December 2013, and two endogenous impulses at the end of December 2013 and during the middle of March 2014. On the basis that the direction of principal stress represents a marker for the direction of landslide mass movement, it has been possible to define six landslide activity modes which correspond to specific stress states. The response of the landslide to the extreme rainfall event was immediate and reflected increasing saturation of the porous landslide mass. The response of the landslide to the endogenous impulses was more complicated as compressional pulses often alternated with gravitational relaxation. In this study, it is demonstrated that the landslide stress state can be determined on the basis of a single-displacement event whenever fault displacements are monitored in three dimensions. This innovative approach may represent a valuable step towards a complete understanding of the kinematic behaviour of potentially catastrophic slope deformations, particularly those which are in a critical stability state.",10505.0,"Blahůt, Jan:Baroň, Ivo:Sokol, L.:Meletlidis, S.:Klimeš, Jan:Rowberry, Matthew David:Melichar, R.:Garcia-Canada, L.:Martí, Xavier",Landslides,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Moving Forwards: A Problem for Full Ectogenesis,"Most existing literature on the ethics of full ectogenesis has proceeded under the presupposition that science will at some point produce sophisticated technologies for full-term gestation (from embryo to infant) outside the human womb, delivering neonate health outcomes comparable with (or even superior to) biological gestation. However, the development of this technology-as opposed to the support systems currently being advanced-would require human subject experiments in embryo-onwards development using ectogenic prototypes. Literature on ectogenic research ethics has so far focused on “backwards” development of partial ectogenesis: incubation and ectogestation technologies that would allow the support of earlier and earlier neonates and foetuses. However, little has been said about the ethics of “forwards” development of (partial or full) ectogenesis, involving the development of embryos and foetuses in prototype environments. Such a prototype might allow us to produce a gestateling or live neonate from a human embryo, but with poorer expected development and health outcomes than from biological gestation, it might also produce only gestatelings (healthy or otherwise) before the technology was developed to a stage where full-term gestation was achievable. This paper explicates some of the ethical issues that this raises for the development of “full” ectogenesis, and presents prima facie reasons to consider this research problematic and therefore to require extensive further argument in its defence.",60302.0,"Baron, Teresa",Bioethics,2,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
MicroRNA dilution during oocyte growth disables the microRNA pathway in mammalian oocytes,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ubiquitous small RNAs guiding post-transcriptional gene repression in countless biological processes. However, the miRNA pathway in mouse oocytes appears inactive and dispensable for development. We propose that marginalization of the miRNA pathway activity stems from the constraints and adaptations of RNA metabolism elicited by the diluting effects of oocyte growth. We report that miRNAs do not accumulate like mRNAs during the oocyte growth because miRNA turnover has not adapted to it. The most abundant miRNAs total tens of thousands of molecules in growing (empty set 40 mu m) and fully grown (empty set 80 mu m) oocytes, a number similar to that observed in much smaller fibroblasts. The lack of miRNA accumulation results in a 100-fold lower miRNA concentration in fully grown oocytes than in somatic cells. This brings a knockdown-like effect, where diluted miRNAs engage targets but are not abundant enough for significant repression. Low-miRNA concentrations were observed in rat, hamster, porcine and bovine oocytes, arguing that miRNA inactivity is not mouse-specific but a common mammalian oocyte feature. Injection of 250,000 miRNA molecules was sufficient to restore reporter repression in mouse and porcine oocytes, suggesting that miRNA inactivity comes from low-miRNA abundance and not from some suppressor of the pathway.",10604.0,"Kataruka, Shubhangini:Modrák, Martin:Kinterová, Veronika:Malík, Radek:Zeitler, D.M.:Horvat, Filip:Kaňka, Jiří:Meister, G.:Svoboda, Petr",Nucleic Acids Research,2,low,high,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Failed Encounters or the Challenges of Rendering Gender a Matter of Concern,"This chapter argues that gender both as embodied performance and as a subject matter participates in (dis)enabling much needed contact zones between the physical sciences, science studies and gender studies, albeit in ways that often go unnoticed. Here I take scientists' propensity to object to, or cast as irrelevant, particular gender performances as a resource to rethink how we might present asymmetrical gender relations in science in ways that incite concern and responsibility. Taking the example of a research presentation, I re-examine how my embodied collaboration with graphs, voices and theory geared to render gender a tangible matter of fact was in part achieved by bracketing the practices and technologies of particular research strategies, casting gender as a social construct rather than a socio-natural hybrid and enacting a mode of critique rather than foregrounding multiple ontologies.

"Resolving power of pixel detector Timepix for wide-range electron, proton and ion detection","The resolving power of the Timepix detector for wide-range charged particle detection has been examined and evaluated in defined radiation fields. The goal is to broadly characterize mixed-radiation fields consisting namely of X-rays and charged particles in terms of particle-types (species), spectral response (energy loss) and direction in wide field-of-view (essentially 2 pi) with a single compact tracking detector. Tests and calibration measurements were performed with the same device at electron, proton and ion fields at various energies and incident directions. Event-by-event detection, together with pattern recognition analysis of the single particle tracks, are exploited to analyze events according to three degrees of freedom-the particle type (X-rays, light and heavy charged particles), energy range (low or high energy-depending on their range being smaller or larger than the pixel size of the detector semiconductor sensor) and direction (incident angle to the sensor plane). Characteristic values are determined for the cluster analysis morphology parameters, the particles stopping power or Linear Energy Transfer and derived correlated quantities. Ratios and correlations between selected parameters are analyzed including 2D-scatter plots. A physics-based wide-range classification is proposed for a total of 8 broad event groups-in terms of light charged particles (electrons, muons) of both low and high energy incident perpendicular (type 1, including X-rays) or high energy non-perpendicular (type 5), protons of low energy omnidirectional (type 2) and high energy non-perpendicular (type 6), alpha particles and light ions of low energy omnidirectional (type 3) and high energy non-perpendicular (type 7), and heavy ions of low energy omnidirectional (type 4) and high energy non-perpendicular (type 8).",10509.0,"Granja, C.:Jakubek, J.:Polansky, S.:Zach, Václav:Krist, Pavel:Chvátil, David:Štursa, Jan:Sommer, Marek:Ploc, Ondřej:Kodaira, S.:Martisikova, M.",Nuclear Instruments & Methods in Physics Research Section A,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Comparison and Negation in Latin,"Comparison of adjectives (and adverbs) is a grammatical category that has thus far received scant attention in Latin linguistics. Latin grammars (with few exceptions, cf. Pinkster, 2005, 47, Kühner - Holzweissig, 1912, 565-6, Neue - Wagener, 1891, 245-6) treat comparison as a category applicable to all adjectives and omit entirely the question of which adjectives can be compared and which cannot for semantic reasons. Nevertheless, data from modern languages show that the category of comparison of adjectives (and adverbs) is actually highly limited. Based on an extensive excerption of Latin texts (the employed corpus comprises more than 10,000 items marked as adjectives in the Oxford Latin Dictionary and all their occurrences throughout the database Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina III), a rough estimate gives that comparative or superlative forms (synthetic and/or periphrastic) are attested in Latin in approximately 14% of adjectives, while both degrees are found in about 7% of adjectives. According to Pinkster and Kühner - Holzweissig, one of the semantic classes where comparison is excluded for semantic reasons is that of &quot,adjectives with negative meaning&quot,. The Oxford Latin Dictionary contains 566 adjectives with the negative prefix in-. Of these 26.1% are attested to be gradable, which means that the proportion of attested gradable negative adjectives, contrary to the claims of the grammars, is actually higher than the proportion of attested gradable Latin adjectives in general. That being the case, this study aims to give a more convincing account of the gradability of negative adjectives than that afforded by the brief statements on this topic in Kühner - Holzweissig and Pinkster.",60203.0,"Pultrová, Lucie",Glotta - Zeitschrift fur Griechische und Lateinische Sprache,2,low,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ionic liquid-silica precursors via solvent-free sol-gel process and their application in epoxy-amine network: a theoretical/experimental study,"This work describes the solvent-free sol–gel synthesis of epoxy-functionalized silica-based precursors in the presence of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) containing different anions: chloride (Cl–) and methanesulfonate (MeSO3–). The IL-driven sol–gel mechanisms were investigated in detail using experimental characterizations (29Si NMR and ATR FTIR spectroscopy) and a theoretical computational method based on density functional theory (DFT). We observed complex IL influence on both hydrolysis and condensation steps, involving especially H-bonding and Coulomb coupling stabilization of the process intermediates. The obtained IL–silica precursors and their further xerogels were widely characterized (rheology measurements, MALDI TOF, 29Si NMR, ATR FTIR, and DFT simulation), which allowed observation of their precise silica structures and established their most energetically favorable conformations. The detected silica structures were dependent on the IL type and varied from highly condensed 3D cage-like to branched ladder-like and cyclic ones. The application of prepared IL–silica precursors as reinforcing additives into the epoxy–amine network led to an improvement in the organic/inorganic interphase interactions through chemical and physical bonding. Uniform and well-dispersed silica aggregates, in the size of approximately 30 nm, were formed when <= 6.8 wt % of each IL–silica precursor was applied into the epoxy–amine network. The use of imidazolium-based ILs contributed to a significant improvement in thermomechanical properties of hybrids and reduced their UV absorption ability compared to that of the reference matrix. All hybrids exhibited an increase in energy to break (up to approximately 53%), elongation at break (up to approximately 43%), shear storage modulus in the rubbery region (up to 4 times), and thermo-oxidative stability.",10404.0,"Perchacz, Magdalena:Donato, R.

"Sulfide, sulfoxide and sulfone bridged acyclic nucleoside phosphonates as inhibitors of the Plasmodium falciparum and human 6-oxopurine phosphoribosyltransferases: Synthesis and evaluation","Hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGXPRT) is a recognized target for antimalarial chemotherapeutics. It synthesises all of the 6-oxopurine nucleoside monophosphates, IMP, GMP and XMP needed by the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). PfHGXPRT is also indirectly responsible for the synthesis of the adenosine monophosphate, AMP. The acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) are a class of PfHGXPRT inhibitors. Prodrugs of these compounds are able to arrest the growth of Pf in cell culture. In the search for new inhibitors of PfHGXPRT, a series of sulfur containing ANPs (thia-ANPs) has been designed and synthesized. These compounds are based on the structure of 2-(phosphonoethoxy)ethylguanine (PEEG) and PEEHx which consist of a purine base (i.e. guanine or hypoxanthine) linked to a phosphonate group by five atoms i.e. four carbons and one oxygen. Here, PEEG and PEEHx were modified by substituting a sulfide, sulfoxide or a sulfone bridge for the oxygen atom in the linker. The effect of these substitutions on the Ki values for human HGPRT and PfHGXPRT was investigated and showed that most of the thia-ANPs distinctively favour PfHGXPRT. For example, the thia-analogue of PEEHx has a Ki value of 0.2 μM for PfHGXPRT, a value 25-fold lower than for the human counterpart. Prodrugs of these compounds have IC50 values in the 4–6 μM range in antimalarial cell-based assays, making them attractive compounds for further development as antimalarial drug leads.",10401.0,"Klejch, Tomáš:Keough, D.

The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology/European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology/European Society of Pathology guidelines for the management of patients with cervical cancer,"Background: Despite significant advances in the screening, detection, and treatment of preinvasive cervical lesions, invasive cervical cancer is the fifth most common cancer in European women. There are large disparities in Europe and worldwide in the incidence, management, and mortality of cervical cancer. Objective: The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO), the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), and the European Society of Pathology (ESP) jointly develop clinically relevant and evidence-based guidelines in order to improve the quality of care for women with cervical cancer across Europe and worldwide. Methods: The ESGO/ESTRO/ESP nominated an international multidisciplinary development group consisting of practicing clinicians and researchers who have demonstrated leadership and expertise in the care and research of cervical cancer (23 experts across Europe). To ensure that the guidelines are evidence based, the current literature identified from a systematic search was reviewed and critically appraised. In the absence of any clear scientific evidence, judgment was based on the professional experience and consensus of the development group. The guidelines are thus based on the best available evidence and expert agreement. Prior to publication, the guidelines were reviewed by 159 international reviewers, selected through ESGO/ESTRO/ESP and including patient representatives. Results: The guidelines cover comprehensively staging, management, and follow-up for patients with cervical cancer. Management includes fertility sparing treatment, stage T1a, T1b1/T2a1, clinically occult cervical cancer diagnosed after simple hysterectomy, early and locally advanced cervical cancer, primary distant metastatic disease, cervical cancer in pregnancy, and recurrent disease.

Changes in microtubule overlap length regulate kinesin-14-driven microtubule sliding,"Microtubule-crosslinking motor proteins, which slide antiparallel microtubules, are required for the remodeling of microtubule networks. Hitherto, all microtubule-crosslinking motors have been shown to slide microtubules at a constant velocity until no overlap remains between them, leading to the breakdown of the initial microtubule geometry. Here, we show in vitro that the sliding velocity of microtubules, driven by human kinesin-14 HSET, decreases when microtubules start to slide apart, resulting in the maintenance of finite-length microtubule overlaps. We quantitatively explain this feedback using the local interaction kinetics of HSET with overlapping microtubules that cause retention of HSET in shortening overlaps. Consequently, the increased HSET density in the overlaps leads to a density-dependent decrease in sliding velocity and the generation of an entropic force that antagonizes the force exerted by the motors. Our results demonstrate that a spatial arrangement of microtubules can regulate the collective action of molecular motors through the local alteration of their individual interaction kinetics.",10610.0,"Braun, Marcus:Lánský, Zdeněk:Szuba, A.:Schwarz, F.

Integration of cell of origin into the clinical CNS International Prognostic Index improves CNS relapse prediction in DLBCL,"Central nervous system (CNS) relapse carries a poor prognosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Integrating biomarkers into the CNS-International Prognostic Index (CNS-IPI) risk model may improve identification of patients at high risk for developing secondary CNS disease. CNS relapse was analyzed in 1418 DLBCL patients treated with obinutuzumab or rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone chemotherapy in the phase 3 GOYA study. Cell of origin (COO) was assessed using gene-expression profiling. BCL2 and MYC protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The impact of CNS-IPI, COO, and BCL2/MYC dual-expression status on CNS relapse was assessed using a multivariate Cox regression model (data available in n=1418, n = 933, and n = 688, respectively). High CNS-IPI score (hazard ratio [HR], 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-12.3, P = .02) and activated B-cell. like (ABC) (HR, 5.2, 95% CI, 2.1-12.9, P = .0004) or unclassified COO subtypes (HR, 4.2, 95% CI, 1.5-11.7, P = .006) were independently associated with CNS relapse. BCL2/MYC dual-expression status did not impact CNS relapse risk. Three risk subgroups were identified based on the presence of high CNS-IPI score and/or ABC/unclassified COO (CNS-IPI-C model): low risk (no risk factors, n 5 450 [48.2%]), intermediate risk (1 factor, n 5 408 [43.7%]), and high risk (both factors, n 5 75 [8.0%]). Two-year CNS relapse rates were 0.5%, 4.4%, and 15.2% in the respective risk subgroups. Combining high CNS-IPI and ABC/unclassified COO improved CNS relapse prediction and identified a patient subgroup at high risk for developing CNS relapse.

Completion of radical hysterectomy does not improve survival of patients with cervical cancer and intraoperatively detected lymph node involvement: ABRAX international retrospective cohort study,"Background: The management of cervical cancer patients with intraoperative detection of lymph node involvement remains controversial. Since all these patients are referred for (chemo)radiation after the surgery, the key decision is whether radical hysterectomy should be completed as originally planned, taking into account an additional morbidity associated with extensive surgical dissection prior to adjuvant treatment. The ABRAX study investigated whether completing a radical uterine procedure is associated with an improved oncological outcome of such patients. Patients and methods: We performed retrospective analyses of 515 cervical cancer patients (51 institutions, 19 countries) who were referred for primary curative surgery between 2005 and 2015 (stage IA-IIB, common tumour types) in whom lymph node involvement was detected intraoperatively. Patients were stratified according to whether the planned uterine surgery was completed (COMPL group, N = 361) or abandoned (ABAND group, N = 154) to compare progression-free survival. Definitive chemoradiation was given to 92.9% patients in the ABAND group and adjuvant (chemo)radiation or chemotherapy to 91.4% of patients in the COMPL group. Results: The risks of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.154, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.799-1.666, P = 0.45), pelvic recurrence (HR 0.836, 95% CI 0.458-1.523, P = 0.56), or death (HR 1.064, 95% CI 0.690-1.641, P = 0.78) were not significantly different between the two groups. No subgroup showed a survival benefit from completing radical hysterectomy. Disease-free survival reached 74% (381/515), with a median follow-up of 58 months. Prognostic factors were balanced between the two groups. FIGO stage and number of pelvic lymph nodes involved were significant prognostic factors in the whole study cohort. Conclusion: We showed that the completion of radical hysterectomy does not improve survival in patients with intraoperatively detected lymph node involvement, regardless of tumour size or histological type. If lymph node involvement is confirmed intraoperatively, abandoning uterine radical procedure should be considered, and the patient should be referred for definitive chemoradiation.",30214.0,"Cibula, David:Dostálek, Lukáš:Hillemanns, P.:Scambia, G.:Jarkovsky, J.:Persson, J.:Raspagliesi, F.:Novak, Z.:Jaeger, A.:Capilna, M.

A constructional approach to conceptual metaphor : The case of COMPLETION IS UP in Chinese,"In this paper, we discuss the relation between conceptual metaphor, conceptual archetype and subjectivity. We start by examining the polysemy of shang in Chinese, given the working of COMPLETION IS UP on its semantics. Based on corpus data, we sketch a possible route of semantic extension and argue that the synchronic distribution of shang is symptomatic of semantic attenuation. We also propose an image-schematic structure for each of the relevant senses of shang identified. With such analysis, we identify VERTICAL ELEVATION and CONTACT as two important conceptual archetypes that may help us understand the semantic extension and how COMPLETION IS UP is actually at work in the semantics of shang.",60200.0,"Lu, Wei-lun",Studies in Figurative Thought and Language,2,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nearly all patients with GBM experience disease progression despite aggressive first-line therapy, with a median time to progression of 6 to 11 months.

Pragmatic Approach to Photodynamics: Mixed Landau-Zener Surface Hopping with Intersystem Crossing,"Ab initio excited state photodynamical simulations have entered the mainstream in the past two decades, bringing techniques of various sophistication and computational requirements for the description of nonadiabatic transitions. We explore in this work the performance of the recently reformulated Landau-Zener surface hopping (LZSH) approach and extend it for the simultaneous treatment of internal conversion and intersystem crossing events. We studied photochemical reactions of four model molecules (cyclopropanone, methaniminium cation, cytosine, and thiophene). The calculated quantities are generally in excellent agreement with the corresponding fewest switches surface hopping simulations. Furthermore, the algorithm proved to be significantly more stable and more computationally efficient. LZSH also puts fewer constraints on the electronic structure theory as the nonadiabatic couplings are not needed. We argue that the accuracy of photodynamical simulations is in practice dominated by the electronic structure theory, and it is, therefore, legitimate to use the simplest and the most efficient technique for the treatment of nonadiabatic transitions.

Flow Regimes in Slurry Bubble Column: Effect of Column Height and Particle Concentration.,"This is an experimental study focussed on the flow regimes and gas holdup behaviour in a lab-scale slurry bubble column (vertical plexiglass cylinder, 0.14 m dia, total height 2 m). The gas distributor was a fine perforated brass plate (0.5 mm dia orifices, free plate area 0.19%), producing both homogeneous (HoR) and heterogeneous (HeR) flow regimes, and the transition between them (TrR). The three-phase gas-liquid-solid mixture was composed of local air, tap water and fine porous silica particles (size 100 μm). The particles were characterized by several methods for their individual and collective properties (optical and electron microscopy, granulometry, porosimetry, effective density and viscosity, granular rheology and bulk properties, effects on liquid conductivity and surface tension). The gas holdup e was measured by bed expansion method, using free layer height evaluated visually or by digital image analysis. Three experimental parameters were tested: gas input q, initial slurry layer height H and concentration of solid particles c. It was found that increasing both H and c reduces gas holdup and destabilizes HoR and enhances its breakdown. At low solid load, the three flow regimes exist for all H tested. At higher solid load, only one regime is observed, the turbulent Pure HeR (PHeR). The experimental data were described with suitable models, based on simple physical concepts used for gas-liquid systems, which were successfully applied also to gas-liquid-solid systems. All four flow regimes observed (HoR, HeR, TrR, PHeR) were fitted with few easy formulas, at the price of few adjustable parameters with clear physical meaning.",20402.0,"Orvalho, Sandra:Hashida, M.:Zedníková, Mária:Stanovský, Petr:Růžička, Marek:Sasaki, S.:Tomiyama, A.",Chemical Engineering Journal,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Immune responses to a recombinant glycoprotein E herpes zoster vaccine in adults age 50 years or older,"Background. The herpes zoster subunit vaccine (HZ/su), consisting of varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE) and AS01B Adjuvant System, was highly efficacious in preventing herpes zoster in the ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 trials. We present immunogenicity results from those trials. Methods. Participants (ZOE-50: ≥50, ZOE-70: ≥70 years of age) received 2 doses of HZ/su or placebo, 2 months apart. Serum anti-gE antibodies and CD4 T cells expressing ≥2 of 4 activation markers assessed (CD42+) after stimulation with gE-peptides were measured in subcohorts for humoral (n = 3293) and cell-mediated (n = 466) immunogenicity. Results. After vaccination, 97.8% of HZ/su and 2.0% of placebo recipients showed a humoral response. Geometric mean anti-gE antibody concentrations increased 39.1-fold and 8.3-fold over baseline in HZ/su recipients at 1 and 36 months post-dose 2, respectively. A gE-specific CD42+ T-cell response was shown in 93.3% of HZ/su and 0% of placebo recipients. Median CD42+ T-cell frequencies increased 24.6-fold (1 month) and 7.9-fold (36 months) over baseline in HZ/su recipients and remained ≥5.6-fold above baseline in all age groups at 36 months. The proportion of CD4 T cells expressing all 4 activation markers increased over time in all age groups. Conclusions.

Clinical and genetic spectra of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease due to mutations in UMOD and MUC1,"Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is an increasingly recognized cause of end-stage kidney disease, primarily due to mutations in UMOD and MUC1. The lack of clinical recognition and the small size of cohorts have slowed the understanding of disease ontology and development of diagnostic algorithms. We analyzed two registries from Europe and the United States to define genetic and clinical characteristics of ADTKD-UMOD and ADTKD-MUC1 and develop a practical score to guide genetic testing. Our study encompassed 726 patients from 585 families with a presumptive diagnosis of ADTKD along with clinical, biochemical, genetic and radiologic data. Collectively, 106 different UMOD mutations were detected in 216/562 (38.4%) of families with ADTKD (303 patients), and 4 different MUC1 mutations in 72/205 (35.1%) of the families that are UMOD-negative (83 patients). The median kidney survival was significantly shorter in patients with ADTKD-MUC1 compared to ADTKD-UMOD (46 vs. 54 years, respectively), whereas the median gout-free survival was dramatically reduced in patients with ADTKD-UMOD compared to ADTKD-MUC1 (30 vs. 67 years, respectively). In contrast to patients with ADTKD-UMOD, patients with ADTKD-MUC1 had normal urinary excretion of uromodulin and distribution of uromodulin in tubular cells. A diagnostic algorithm based on a simple score coupled with urinary uromodulin measurements separated patients with ADTKD-UMOD from those with ADTKD-MUC1 with a sensitivity of 94.1%, a specificity of 74.3% and a positive predictive value of 84.2% for aUMODmutation. Thus, ADTKD-UMOD is more frequently diagnosed than ADTKD-MUC1, ADTKD subtypes present with distinct clinical features, and a simple score coupled with urine uromodulin measurements may help prioritizing genetic testing.",10600.0,"Olinger, Eric:Hofmann, Patrick:Kidd, Kendrah:Dufour, Ines:Belge, Hendrica:Schaeffer, Celine:Kipp, Anne:Bonny, Olivier:Deltas, Constantinos:Demoulin, Nathalie:Fehr, Thomas:Fuster, Daniel G:Gale, Daniel P:Goffin, Eric:Hodaňová, Kateřina:Huynh-Do, Uyen:Kistler, Andreas:Morelle, Johann:Papagregoriou, Gregory:Pirson, Yves:Sandford, Richard:Sayer, John A:Torra, Roser:Venzin, Christina:Venzin, Reto:Vogt, Bruno:Živná, Martina:Greka, Anna:Dahan, Karin:Rampoldi, Luca:Kmoch, Stanislav:Bleyer, Anthony:Devuyst, Olivier",Kidney International,2,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

STRC deletion is a frequent cause of slight to moderate congenital hearing impairment in the Czech Republic,"Objective: This study aimed to clarify the molecular epidemiology of hearing loss by identifying the responsible genes in patients without GJB2 mutations. Study design: Prospective genetic study. Setting: Tertiary referral hospital. Patients: Fifty one patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, 20 men, and 31 women, mean age 24.9 years, range 3 to 64 years, from 49 families. GJB2 and deltaGJB6-D13S1830 mutations were excluded previously. Intervention: Diagnostic. Sixty-nine genes reported to be causative of hearing loss were analyzed. Sequence capture technology, next-generation sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were used. Coverage of STRC was screened in Integrative Genomics Viewer software. Main outcome measure: Identification of causal pathogenic mutations in genes related to deafness. Results: Five families (10%) had recessive STRC deletions or mutations. Five unrelated patients (10%) had recessive mutations in TMPRSS3, USH2A, PCDH15, LOXHD1, and MYO15A. Three families (6%) had autosomal dominant mutations in MYO6A, KCNQ4, and SIX1. One family (2%) had an X-linked POU3F4 mutation. Thus, we identified the cause of hearing loss in 28% of the families studied. Conclusions: Following GJB2, STRC was the second most frequently mutated gene in patients from the Czech Republic with hearing loss. To decrease the cost of testing, we recommend STRC deletion screening with MLPA before next-generation sequencing. The existence of a pseudogene and polymorphic STRC regions can lead to false-positive or false-negative results when copy number variation analysis is based on next-generation sequencing data.",30101.0,"Plevová, Pavlína:Paprskářová, Martina:Tvrdá, Petra:Turská, Petra:Slavkovský, Rastislav:Mrázková, E.",Otology & Neurotology,2,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The culture of orphaned texts: Academic books in a performance-based evaluation system,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the body of knowledge on how research evaluation in different national and organisational contexts affects, often in unintended ways, research and publication practices. In particular, it looks at the development of book publication in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in the Czech Republic since 2004, when a performance-based system of evaluation was introduced, up to the present.nDesign/methodology/approach – The paper builds upon ethnographic research complemented by the analysis of Czech science policy documents, data available in the governmental database “Information Register of R&D results” and formal and informal interviews with expert evaluators and other stakeholders in the research system. It further draws on the authors’ own experience as scholars, who have also over the years participated in a number of evaluation procedures as peers and experts.nFindings – The number of books published by researchers in SSH based at Czech institutions has risen considerably in reaction to the pressure for productivity that is inscribed into the evaluation methodology and has resulted in the rise of in-house publishing by researchers’ own research institution, “fake internationalisation” using foreign low-quality presses as the publication venue, and the development of a culture of orphaned books that have no readers.nPractical implications – In the Czech Republic robust and internationally harmonised bibliometric data regarding books would definitely help to create a form of research evaluation that would stimulate meaningful scholarly book production. At the same time, better-resourced and better-designed peer review evaluation is needed.nOriginality/value – This is the first attempt to analyse in detail the conditions and consequences the Czech performance-based research evaluation system has for SSH book publication. The paper demonstrates that often discussed harming of SSH and book-writing in particular by performance-based IF-centred research evaluation does not necessarily manifest in declining numbers of publications. On the contrary, the number of books published may increase at the cost of producing more texts of questionable scholarly quality.n",50404.0,"Brož, Luděk:Stöckelová, Tereza",Aslib Journal of Information Management,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Insight into boron-doped diamond Raman spectra characteristic features,"Characteristic Raman features of boron-doped diamond layers with metallic conduction are studied experimentally and discussed in comparison with an extensive selection of literature data. Despite evidence that the main Raman bands are mostly characteristic features of carbon atom vibration modes, their position is found to be proportional to boron concentration. While the origin of the Raman bands located at c.a. 500 cm(-1) remains unclear, the band centred at c.a. 1200 cm(-1) is attributed to a maximum of phonon density of states due to softening of the Raman wave vector conservation rule. The downshift and broadening of the diamond line are attributed, primarily, to the domain size effect caused by scattering on boron impurities, secondly to the Fano effect due to electronic Raman interaction, and finally to lattice expansion due to the boron doping.

Sixty-nine individuals had a REN mutation in the signal peptide region (signal group), 27 in the prosegment (prosegment group), and 15 in the mature renin peptide (mature group). Signal group patients were most severely affected, presenting at a mean age of 19.7 years, with the prosegment group presenting at 22.4 years, and the mature group at 37 years. Anemia was present in childhood in 91% in the signal group, 69% prosegment, and none of the mature group. REN signal peptide mutations reduced hydrophobicity of the signal peptide, which is necessary for recognition and translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to aberrant delivery of preprorenin into the cytoplasm. REN mutations in the prosegment led to deposition of prorenin and renin in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and decreased prorenin secretion. Mutations in mature renin led to deposition of the mutant prorenin in the endoplasmic reticulum, similar to patients with ADTKD-UMOD, with a rate of progression to end stage kidney disease (63.6 years) that was significantly slower vs. the signal (53.1 years) and prosegment groups (50.8 years) (significant hazard ratio 0.367). Thus, clinical and laboratory studies revealed subtypes of ADTKD-REN that are pathophysiologically, diagnostically, and clinically distinct.",10600.0,"Živná, Martina:Kidd, Kendrah:Zaidan, Mohamad:Vyleťal, Petr:Barešová, Veronika:Hodaňová, Kateřina:Sovová, Jana:Hartmannová, Hana:Votruba, Miroslav:Trešlová, Helena:Jedličková, Ivana:Sikora, Jakub:Hůlková, Helena:Robins, Victoria:Hnizda, Ales:Živný, Jan:Papagregoriou, Gregory:Mesnard, Laurent:Beck, Bodo B.:Wenzel, Andrea:Tory, Kalman:Haeeffner, Karsten:Wolf, Matthias T.

"Adhesive joints in glass structures: effects of various materials in the connection, thickness of the adhesive layer, and ageing","This paper reports on an investigation of glued joints in glass load-bearing structures, with reference to the effect of various substrates (glass, steel, stainless steel, aluminium) and their surface treatment (sandblasting for the glass surface) on the adhesion of selected adhesives. The thickness of the adhesive layer and the effect of artificial ageing - a simulation of 5 years of ageing in outdoor central-European conditions - are also discussed. Tensile and shear tests were carried out on three series of specimens with various adhesives and substrates - two series for tensile and shear tests, and one series for shear tests on specimens exposed to ageing. Our results show that sandblasting the glass surface can improve the adhesion, and thus the strength values, of an adhesive joint in cases where, with a smooth glass surface, cohesive failure is not reached. The thickness of the adhesive layer had a significant effect for a semi-rigid acrylate adhesive, where the joint achieved higher strength values with less thickness of the glue. The effect of ageing varied according to the adhesive. The most visible changes were observed for a two-component acrylate adhesive and for methacrylate UV-adhesives. One of the selected glues was marked as unsuitable for load-bearing connections due to significant worsening of its mechanical properties after ageing.",20101.0,"Machalická, Klára:Eliášová, Martina",International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A Subset of New Platinum Antitumor Agents Kills Cells by a Multimodal Mechanism of Action Also Involving Changes in the Organization of the Microtubule Cytoskeleton,"The substitution inert platinum agent [Pt(1S,2S-diamino cyclohexane) (5,6-dimethyl-1,10-ph enanthroline)](2+) (56MeSS, 5) is a potent cytotoxic metallodrug. In contrast to conventional cisplatin or oxaliplatin, the mechanism of action (MoA) of 5 is fundamentally different. However, details of the mechanism by which the 5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline ligand contributes to the cytotoxicity of 5 and its derivatives have not been sufficiently clarified so far. Here, we show that 5 and its Pt(IV) derivatives exhibit an intriguing potency in the triple-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. Moreover, we show that the Pt(IV) derivatives of 5 act by multimodal MoA resulting in the global biological effects, that is, they damage nuclear DNA, reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential, induce the epigenetic processes, and last but not least, the data provide evidence that changes in the organization of cytoskeleton networks are functionally important for 5 and its derivatives, in contrast to clinically used platinum cytostatics, to kill cancer cells.",30107.0,"Kostrhunová, Hana:Zajac, Juraj:Novohradský, Vojtěch:Kašpárková, Jana:Malina, Jaroslav:Aldrich-Wright, J.R.:Petruzzella, V.:Sirota, R.:Gibson, D.:Brabec, Viktor",Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,2,high,high,1,0,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While the origin of the Raman bands located at c.a. 500 cm-1 remains unclear, the band centred at c.a. 1200 cm-1 is attributed to a maximum of phonon density of states due to softening of the Raman wave vector conservation rule.

Effect of various chemical oxidation agents on soil microbial communities,"Chemical oxidations by hydrogen peroxide and/or persulfate represent promising pretreatment step foregoing bioremediation for removal of hydrophobic contaminants. The feasibility of hydrogen peroxidebased and sodium persulfate-based oxidation treatments on the real contaminated soil collected from petroleum lagoon deposit were evaluated. The results showed poor insignificant degradation of pollutants (expressed as C10?C40 concentration) in hydrogen peroxide variants (avg. of 9% ? 30% decrease) in comparison to persulfate treatment variants (avg. of 55% ? 13% decrease). In accordance, microbial community activity indicators showed substantial inhibition of viability only by persulfate, base and Fe3+ activated variants. The highest contaminant removal efficiency was achieved by Fe3+ activated persulfate system (78% ? 3%).

Agrotechnology as Key Factor in Effective Use of Water on Arable Land,"It is indisputable that water is necessary for the food production. Demand for good-quality food puts pressure on the agricultural production. On the other hand, a lack of fresh water has become a serious problem. Southern Europe faces this problem in particular nowadays. One-third of water is consumed in the agricultural sector in Europe (plant production in particular). Agriculture influences the amount of water available, and the quality of water is tightly connected with the intensity of farming and use of crop protection agents and fertilizers. Such a bad fresh water situation in the agriculture will improve or stabilize, if water is used more efficiently (e.g. irrigation) or it is retained in the agricultural land. Suitable agricultural interventions must be made. Climate change has also provoked worse availability and accessibility of water. Water development scenarios, distribution and frequency of precipitation predict the amount of fresh water to be reduced in Europe, and they also predict changes in freshwater distribution from the place and time points of view. If suitable agrotechnological techniques are adopted, and sociopolitical solutions are supported, water situation will improve significantly, and it will be used more efficiently in the agriculture. More water will be available for the agricultural production, and more water will be kept for the whole agroecosystem.",40101.0,"Bernas, Jaroslav:Konvalina, Petr:Brom, Jakub:Moudrý, Jan:Veselá, Tereza:Bucur, Daniel:Marcel, Dirja:Sangin, Shim",Assessment and Protection of Water Resources in the Czech Republic,2,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Apolipoprotein M: a novel adipokine decreasing with obesity and upregulated by calorie restriction,"BACKGROUND: The adipose tissue (AT) is a secretory organ producing a wide variety of factors that participate in the genesis of metabolic disorders linked to excess fat mass. Weight loss improves obesity-related disorders. OBJECTIVES: Transcriptomic studies on human AT, and a combination of analyses of transcriptome and proteome profiling of conditioned media from adipocytes and stromal cells isolated from human AT, have led to the identification of apolipoprotein M (apoM) as a putative adipokine. We aimed to validate apoM as novel adipokine, investigate the relation of AT APOM expression with metabolic syndrome and insulin sensitivity, and study the regulation of its expression in AT and secretion during calorie restriction-induced weight loss. METHODS: We examined APOM mRNA level and secretion in AT from 485 individuals enrolled in 5 independent clinical trials, and in vitro in human multipotent adipose-derived stem cell adipocytes. APOM expression and secretion were measured during dieting. RESULTS: APOM was expressed in human subcutaneous and visceral AT, mainly by adipocytes. ApoM was released into circulation from AT, and plasma apoM concentrations correlate with AT APOM mRNA levels. In AT, APOM expression inversely correlated with adipocyte size, was lower in obese compared to lean individuals, and reduced in subjects with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Regardless of fat depot, there was a positive relation between AT APOM expression and systemic insulin sensitivity, independently of fat mass and plasma HDL cholesterol. In human multipotent adipose-derived stem cell adipocytes, APOM expression was enhanced by insulin-sensitizing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists and inhibited by tumor necrosis factor α, a cytokine that causes insulin resistance. In obese individuals, calorie restriction increased AT APOM expression and secretion. CONCLUSIONS: ApoM is a novel adipokine, the expression of which is a hallmark of healthy AT and is upregulated by calorie restriction. AT apoM deserves further investigation as a potential biomarker of risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.",30202.0,"Šrámková, Veronika:Berend, Sarah:Šiklová, Michaela:Caspar-Bauguil, Sylvie:Carayol, Jérôme:Bonnel, Sophie:Marques, Marie:Decaunes, Pauline:Kolditz, Catherine-Inès:Dahlman, Ingrid:Arner, Peter:Štich, Vladimír:Saris, Wim H.

It explains the relationship between myth and stereotype and, in accordance with recent psychological and sociological research, considers stereotypes to be a specific kind of so-called “legitimizing myths.” The background against which the stereotypes are explored is the myth of the origin of Appalachian people. Discussing Sarah Hardy’s research into affinities between short stories and oral narratives, Lisa Alther’s historical investigation of the Melungeons, and Chris Offutt’s theoretical remarks about storytelling, the article shows that it is the close relationship of short stories with folk tales that makes the short story the best genre for rendering myths and stereotypes.",60206.0,"Arbeit, Marcel",Journal of The Short Story in English / Les Cahiers de la nouvelle,2,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Single-round deoxyribozyme discovery,"Artificial evolution experiments typically use libraries of ∼1015 sequences and require multiple rounds of selection to identify rare variants with a desired activity. Based on the simple structures of some aptamers and nucleic acid enzymes, we hypothesized that functional motifs could be isolated from significantly smaller libraries in a single round of selection followed by high-throughput sequencing. To test this idea, we investigated the catalytic potential of DNA architectures in which twelve or fifteen randomized positions were embedded in a scaffold present in all library members. After incubating in either the presence or absence of lead (which promotes the nonenzymatic cleavage of RNA), library members that cleaved themselves at an RNA linkage were purified by PAGE and characterized by high-throughput sequencing. These selections yielded deoxyribozymes with activities 8- to 30-fold lower than those previously isolated under similar conditions from libraries containing 1014 different sequences, indicating that the disadvantage of using a less diverse pool can be surprisingly small. It was also possible to elucidate the sequence requirements and secondary structures of deoxyribozymes without performing additional experiments. Due to its relative simplicity, we anticipate that this approach will accelerate the discovery of new catalytic DNA and RNA motifs.",10608.0,"Streckerová, Tereza:Kurfürst, Jaroslav:Curtis, Edward A.",Nucleic Acids Research,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Human osteoblast-like SAOS-2 cells on submicron-scale fibers coated with nanocrystalline diamond films,"A unique composite nanodiamond-based porous material with a hierarchically-organized submicron-nanostructure was constructed for potential bone tissue engineering. This material consisted of submicron fibers prepared by electrospinning of silicon oxide (SiOx), which were oxygen-terminated (O-SiOx) and were hermetically coated with nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films. The NCD films were then terminated with hydrogen (HNCD) or oxygen (O-NCD). The materials were tested as substrates for the adhesion, growth and osteogenic differentiation of human osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells. The number and the spreading area of the initially adhered cells, their growth rate during 7 days after seeding and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly higher on the NCD-coated samples than on the uncoated 0-SiO x samples. In addition, the concentration of type I collagen was significantly higher in the cells on the O-NCD-coated samples than on the bare O-SiOx samples. The observed differences could be attributed to the tunable wettability of NCD and to the more appropriate surface morphology of the NCD-coated samples in contrast to the less stable, rapidly eroding bare SiOx surface. The H-NCD coatings and the O-NCD coatings both promoted similar initial adhesion of Saos-2 cells, but the subsequent cell proliferation activity was higher on the O-NCD-coated samples. The concentration of beta-actin, vinculin, type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the ALP activity, and also the calcium deposition tended to be higher in the cells on the O-NCD-coated samples than on the H-NCD-coated samples, although these differences did not reach statistical significance. The improved cell performance on the O-NCD-coated samples could be attributed to higher wettability of these samples (water drop contact angle less than 10 degrees), while the H-NCD-coated samples were hydrophobic (contact angle >701. NCD-coated porous SiOx meshes can therefore be considered as appropriate scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, particularly those with an O-terminated NCD coating.",30404.0,"Steinerová, Marie:Matějka, Roman:Štěpanovská, Jana:Filová, Elena:Staňková, Ľubica:Rysová, M.:Martinová, L.:Dragounová, Helena:Domonkos, Mária:Artemenko, Anna:Babchenko, Oleg:Otáhal, M.:Bačáková, Lucie:Kromka, Alexander",Materials Science & Engineering C-Materials for Biological Applications,2,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Can glomalin content be used as an indicator for erosion damage to soil and related changes in organic matter characteristics and nutrients?,"Erosion is a serious global problem for agricultural land and agroecosystems in general. In the Czech Republic (CZ) erosion affects approximately two-thirds of total agricultural land. In order to evaluate the influence of erosion processes on soil properties, besides traditional parameters relating to soil organic matter, we also focused on glomalin as a product of mycorrhizal fungi and on spores of such fungi. The aim was to verify the sensitivity of this parameter to changes in the soil environment as a result of soil degradation, how it correlates with other soil characteristics, and how useful it is for indicating changes in soil properties. The research was carried out on 48 localities in erosion-threatened areas of Southern Moravia, CZ. Erosional, depositional and control (source) sites located on different slopes were selected using erosion-deposition models. Most statistically significant differences were recorded between erosional and depositional sites, the latter showing higher concentrations in both glomalin and characteristics relating to soil organic matter and content of nutrients. Comparison between source and erosional sites also showed statistically significant differences - higher values of both glomalin and characteristics relating to the quantity and quality of soil organic matter were found in source areas. Moreover, we also found statistically significant differences in the number of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spores. On the other hand, no statistically significant differences in selected nutrients were found between control and erosional sites. Within our research, source areas did not differ significantly from those of deposition. In evaluating all results, strong correlations were found especially between glomalin and the quantity and quality of organic matter. It was in relation to glomalin that the most correlations were found to the other tested parameters. Our results suggest the possibility of using glomalin values in determining changes in soil properties during degradation processes, e.g. soil erosion.",10618.0,"Šarapatka, Bořivoj:Alvarado Solano, Diana Patricia:Čižmár, David",CATENA,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Re-examination of species limits in Aspergillus section Flavipedes using advanced species delimitation methods and description of four new species,"Since the last revision in 2015, the taxonomy of section Flavipedes evolved rapidly along with the availability of new species delimitation techniques. This study aims to re-evaluate the species boundaries of section Flavipedes members using modern delimitation methods applied to an extended set of strains (n = 90) collected from various environments. The analysis used DNA sequences of three house-keeping genes (benA, CaM, RPB2) and consisted of two steps: application of several single-locus (GMYC, bGMYC, PTP, bPTP) and multi-locus (STACEY) species delimitation methods to sort the isolates into putative species, which were subsequently validated using DELINEATE software that was applied for the first time in fungal taxonomy. As a result, four new species are introduced, i.e. A. alboluteus, A. alboviridis, A. inusitatus and A. lanuginosus, and A. capensis is synonymized with A. iizukae. Phenotypic analyses were performed for the new species and their relatives, and the results showed that the growth parameters at different temperatures and colonies characteristics were useful for differentiation of these taxa. The revised section harbors 18 species, most of them are known from soil. However, the most common species from the section are ecologically diverse, occurring in the indoor environment (six species), clinical samples (five species), food and feed (four species), droppings (four species) and other less common substrates/environments. Due to the occurrence of section Flavipedes species in the clinical material/hospital environment, we also evaluated the susceptibility of 67 strains to six antifungals (amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, isavuconazole, terbinafine) using the reference EUCAST method. These results showed some potentially clinically relevant differences in susceptibility between species. For example, MICs higher than those observed for A. fumigatus wild-type were found for both triazoles and amphotericin B for A. ardalensis, A. iizukae, and A. spelaeus whereas A. lanuginosus, A. luppiae, A. movilensis, A. neoflavipes, A. olivimuriae and A. suttoniae were comparable to or more susceptible as A. fumigatus.

Petrogenesis of orogenic lamproites of the Bohemian Massif: Sr-Nd-Pb-Li isotope constraints for Variscan enrichment of ultra-depleted mantle domains,"During convergence of Gondwana-derived microplates and Laurussia in the Palaeozoic, subduction of oceanic and continental crusts and their sedimentary cover introduced material of regionally contrasting chemical and isotopic compositions into the mantle. This slab material metasomatised the local mantle, producing a highly heterogeneous lithospheric mantle beneath the European Variscides. The eastern termination of the European Variscides (Moldanubian and Saxo-Thuringian zones of Austria, Czech Republic, Germany and Poland) is unusual in that the mantle was modified by material from several subduction zones within a small area. Orogenic lamproites sampled this lithospheric mantle, which has a chemical signature reflecting extreme depletion (low CaO and Al.sub2O3 contents and high Mg-number) followed by strong metasomatic enrichment, giving rise to crust-like trace element patterns, variable radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr(330) (0.7062-0.7127) and non-radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions (εNd(330) = -2.8 to -7.8), crustal Pb isotopic compositions, and a wide range of δ7Li values (-5.1 to +5.1). This metasomatic signature is variably expressed in the lamproites, depending on the extent of melting and the nature of the source of the metasomatic component. Preferential melting of the metasomatically enriched (veined) lithospheric mantle with K-rich amphibole resulted in lamproitic melts with very negative, crust-like δ7Li values, which correlate positively with peralkalinity, HFSE contents and lower εNd.

Effects of Extreme Ritual Practices on Psychophysiological Well-Being,"Extreme ritual practices involving pain and suffering pose significant risks such as injury, trauma, or infection. Nonetheless, they are performed by millions of people around the world and are often culturally prescribed remedies for a variety of maladies, and especially those related to mental health. What is the actual impact of these practices on health? Combining ethnographic observations and psychophysiological monitoring, we investigated outcomes of participation in one of the world’s most extreme rituals, involving bodily mutilation and prolonged suffering. Performance of this physically demanding ordeal had no detrimental effects on physiological health and was associated with subjective health improvements, and these improvements were greater for those who engaged in more intense forms of participation. Moreover, individuals who experienced health problems and/or were of low socioeconomic status sought more painful levels of engagement. We suggest two potential mechanisms for these effects: a bottom-up process triggered by neurological responses to pain and a top-down process related to increased social support and self-enhancement. These mechanisms may buffer stress-induced pressures and positively affect quality of life. Our results stress the importance of traditional cultural practices for coping with adversity, especially in contexts where psychiatric or other medical interventions are not widely available.",60304.0,"Xygalatas, Dimitrios:Khan, Sammyh:Lang, Martin:Kundt, Radek:Kundtová Klocová, Eva:Krátký, Jan:Shaver, John Hayward",Current Anthropology,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chemical variation, modal composition and classification of granitoids","Granites (s.l.) come in many types and flavours, defining distinct magmatic series/suites/types. A good classification not only gives generally accepted and understandable names to similar rocks, but also links the bulk chemical composition to the stoichiometry of the constituent minerals and, potentially, also to the likely source, magmatic evolution and tectonic setting.The ‘ideal’ granitoid classification should be based on chemical criteria amenable to an objective treatment. Statistical analysis helps to identify the most discriminant variables. The key properties are (i) acidity/maficity, (ii) alkalinity (balance of Na + K v. Ca), (iii) aluminosity (balance of Al v. Ca, Na and K), (iv) Fe/Mg balance and (v) Na/K balance and K contents at the given SiO2 level. These are used by successful classifications, e.g., the I/S dichotomy is based mainly on aluminosity, and the Frost et al. (2001) classification includes all but Na/K. While it is commonplace to use weight percentages of oxides, we suggest that a better strategy is to employ simple atomic parameters (e.g., millications-based) that can be directly linked to modal proportions and compositions/crystal structure of individual rock-forming minerals. This facilitates a petrological interpretation, which in turn can be related to petrogenesis and, ultimately, to likely tectonic setting(s).",10505.0,"Janoušek, Vojtěch:Bonin, Bernard:Moyen, Jean-Francois",Post-Archaean Granitic Rocks: Contrasting Petrogenetic Processes and Tectonic Environments,2,low,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Light-Activated Intercluster Conversion of an Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster,"Noble metal nanoclusters protected with carboranes, a 12-vertex, nearly icosahedral boron-carbon framework system, have received immense attention due to their different physicochemical properties. We have synthesized ortho-carborane-1,2-dithiol (CBDT) and triphenylphosphine (TPP) coprotected [Ag42(CBDT)15(TPP)4]2- (shortly Ag42) using a ligand-exchange induced structural transformation reaction starting from [Ag18H16(TPP)10]2+ (shortly Ag18). The formation of Ag42 was confirmed using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Multiple UV-vis optical absorption features, which exhibit characteristic patterns, confirmed its molecular nature. Ag42 is the highest nuclearity silver nanocluster protected with carboranes reported so far. Although these clusters are thermally stable up to 200 °C in their solid state, light-irradiation of its solutions in dichloromethane results in its structural conversion to [Ag14(CBDT)6(TPP)6] (shortly Ag14). Single crystal X-ray diffraction of Ag14 exhibits Ag8-Ag6 core-shell structure of this nanocluster. Other spectroscopic and microscopic studies also confirm the formation of Ag14. Time-dependent mass spectrometry revealed that this light-activated intercluster conversion went through two sets of intermediate clusters. The first set of intermediates, [Ag37(CBDT)12(TPP)4]3- and [Ag35(CBDT)8(TPP)4]2- were formed after 8 h of light irradiation, and the second set comprised of [Ag30(CBDT)8(TPP)4]2-, [Ag26(CBDT)11(TPP)4]2-, and [Ag26(CBDT)7(TPP)7]2- were formed after 16 h of irradiation. After 24 h, the conversion to Ag14 was complete. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the kernel-centered excited state molecular orbitals of Ag42 are responsible for light-activated transformation. Interestingly, Ag42 showed near-infrared emission at 980 nm (1.26 eV) with a lifetime of >1.5 μs, indicating phosphorescence, while Ag14 shows red luminescence at 626 nm (1.98 eV) with a lifetime of 550 ps, indicating fluorescence. Femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption showed the transitions between their electronic energy levels and associated carrier dynamics. Formation of the stable excited states of Ag42 is shown to be responsible for the core transformation.",10402.0,"Jana, A. D.:Jash, M.:Poonia, A. K.:Paramasivam, G.:Islam, M.

Turing conditions for pattern forming systems on evolving manifolds,"The study of pattern-forming instabilities in reaction-diffusion systems on growing or otherwise time-dependent domains arises in a variety of settings, including applications in developmental biology, spatial ecology, and experimental chemistry. Analyzing such instabilities is complicated, as there is a strong dependence of any spatially homogeneous base states on time, and the resulting structure of the linearized perturbations used to determine the onset of instability is inherently non-autonomous. We obtain general conditions for the onset and structure of diffusion driven instabilities in reaction-diffusion systems on domains which evolve in time, in terms of the time-evolution of the Laplace-Beltrami spectrum for the domain and functions which specify the domain evolution. Our results give sufficient conditions for diffusive instabilities phrased in terms of differential inequalities which are both versatile and straightforward to implement, despite the generality of the studied problem. These conditions generalize a large number of results known in the literature, such as the algebraic inequalities commonly used as a sufficient criterion for the Turing instability on static domains, and approximate asymptotic results valid for specific types of growth, or specific domains. We demonstrate our general Turing conditions on a variety of domains with different evolution laws, and in particular show how insight can be gained even when the domain changes rapidly in time, or when the homogeneous state is oscillatory, such as in the case of Turing-Hopf instabilities. Extensions to higher-order spatial systems are also included as a way of demonstrating the generality of the approach.",10102.0,"Van Gorder, Robert A.:Klika, Václav:Krause, Andrew L.",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2,high,high,0,1,high,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Do water's electrons care about electrolytes?,"Ions have a profound effect on the geometrical structure of liquid water and an aqueous environment is known to change the electronic structure of ions. Here we combine photoelectron spectroscopy measurements from liquid microjets with molecular dynamical and quantum chemical calculations to address the reverse question, to what extent do ions affect the electronic structure of liquid water? We study aqueous solutions of sodium iodide (NaI) over a wide concentration range, from nearly pure water to 8 M solutions, recording spectra in the 5 to 60 eV binding energy range to include all water valence and the solute Na + 2p, I - 4d, and I - 5p orbital ionization peaks. We observe that the electron binding energies of the solute ions change only slightly as a function of electrolyte concentration, less than 150 ± 60 meV over an ∼8 M range. Furthermore, the photoelectron spectrum of liquid water is surprisingly mildly affected as we transform the sample from a dilute aqueous salt solution to a viscous, crystalline-like phase. The most noticeable spectral changes are a negative binding energy shift of the water 1b 2 ionizing transition (up to -370 ± 60 meV) and a narrowing of the flat-top shape water 3a 1 ionization feature (up to 450 ± 90 meV). A novel computationally efficient technique is introduced to calculate liquid-state photoemission spectra using small clusters from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations embedded in dielectric continuum. This theoretical treatment captured the characteristic positions and structures of the aqueous photoemission peaks, reproducing the experimentally observed narrowing of the water 3a 1 feature and weak sensitivity of the water binding energies to electrolyte concentration. The calculations allowed us to attribute the small binding energy shifts to ion-induced disruptions of intermolecular electronic interactions. Furthermore, they demonstrate the importance of considering concentration-dependent screening lengths for a correct description of the electronic structure of solvated systems. Accounting for electronic screening, the calculations highlight the minimal effect of electrolyte concentration on the 1b 1 binding energy reference, in accord with the experiments. This leads us to a key finding that the isolated, lowest-binding-energy, 1b 1 , photoemission feature of liquid water is a robust energetic reference for aqueous liquid microjet photoemission studies.",10403.0,"Pohl, Marvin N.:Muchová, Eva:Seidel, Robert:Ali, Hebatallah:Sršeň, Štěpán:Wilkinson, Iain:Winter, Bernd:Slavíček, Petr",Chemical Science,2,low,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pavement patterns can be designed to improve gait in Parkinson's disease patients,"Background: Public spaces are usually designed with respect to various patient populations, but not Parkinson&apos,s disease. The objective of this study was to explore what type of easily applicable visual cueing might be used in public spaces and some interiors to improve gait in people with Parkinson&apos,s disease. Methods: Thirty-two patients with freezing of gait walked an 8-meter track on 6 different floor patterns in single- and dual-task conditions in random sequence. The reference pattern was a virtual large transverse chessboard, and the other patterns differed either in size (small floor stones), orientation (diagonal), nature (real paving), regularity (irregular), or no pattern. Time, number of steps, velocity, step length, cadence, and dual-task effect were calculated. The number and total duration of freezing episodes were analyzed. Results: Virtual, large, transverse floor stones improve time (P = 0.0101), velocity (P = 0.0029), number of steps (P = 0.0291), and step length (P = 0.0254) in Parkinson&apos,s disease patients compared with walking on no pattern. Virtual floor stones were superior in time and velocity to the real ones. Transverse floor stones were better than diagonal, whereas regular pattern stones were superior to irregular in some gait parameters. Subjectively, the reference pattern was preferred to the irregular one and to no pattern. No direct effect on freezing of gait was observed. Conclusions: Parkinson&apos,s disease patients may benefit from floor patterns incorporating transverse oriented large rectangular visual cues.

Not so global climate change? Representations of post-socialist cities in the academic writings on climate change and urban areas,"Climate change is the epitome of a global issue. Cities and their inhabitants face locally specific, yet still globally shared and interconnected problems from heat waves, storms, coastal or fluvial floods to water scarcity, all of which puts pressure on their infrastructure as well as social institutions. Yet, it has been argued that academic research on cities and climate change has so far represented the urban world fractionally, as most case studies of cities are from the developed world. Moreover, urban scholars have been criticized for not being able to fully grasp the transformations that cities are undergoing, nor being able to apply critical urban theory to this field. This article uses these stimuli to critically review current internationally published research on “post-socialist cities” in the context of climate change. It observes how empirical research in this multidisciplinary area is, first, still relatively scarce and especially very recent, and second, that it is largely disconnected from conceptual debates led in urban studies. I argue that this underdeveloped discussion not only slows down development of a more critical academic perspective on the issue that would be based in urban studies of Central and East European cities, but it can also impact how responses to climate change are thought through by local actors.",50401.0,"Ferenčuhová, Slavomíra",Eurasian Geography and Economics,2,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Validation of the PALM model system 6.0 in a real urban environment: a case study in Dejvice, Prague, the Czech Republic","In recent years, the PALM 6.0 modelling system has been rapidly developing its capability to simulate physical processes within urban environments. Some examples in this regard are energy-balance solvers for building and land surfaces, a radiative transfer model to account for multiple reflections and shading, a plant-canopy model to consider the effects of plants on flow (thermo)dynamics, and a chemistry transport model to enable simulation of air quality. This study provides a thorough evaluation of modelled meteorological, air chemistry, and ground and wall-surface quantities against dedicated in situ measurements taken in an urban environment in Dejvice, Prague, the Czech Republic. Measurements included monitoring of air quality and meteorology in street canyons, surface temperature scanning with infrared cameras, and monitoring of wall heat fluxes. Large-eddy simulations (LES) using the PALM model driven by boundary conditions obtained from a mesoscale model were performed for multiple days within two summer and three winter episodes characterized by different atmospheric conditions.  For the simulated episodes, the resulting temperature, wind speed, and chemical compound concentrations within street canyons show a realistic representation of the observed state, except that the LES did not adequately capture night-time cooling near the surface for certain meteorological conditions. In some situations, insufficient turbulent mixing was modelled, resulting in higher near-surface concentrations. At most of the evaluation points, the simulated surface temperature reproduces the observed surface temperature reasonably well for both absolute and daily amplitude values. However, especially for the winter episodes and for modern buildings with multilayer walls, the heat transfer through walls is not well captured in some cases, leading to discrepancies between the modelled and observed wall-surface temperature. Furthermore, the study corroborates model dependency on the accuracy of the input data. In particular, the temperatures of surfaces affected by nearby trees strongly depend on the spatial distribution of the leaf area density, land surface temperatures at grass surfaces strongly depend on the initial soil moisture, wall-surface temperatures depend on the correct setting of wall material parameters, and concentrations depend on detailed information on spatial distribution of emissions, all of which are often unavailable at sufficient accuracy. The study also points out some current model limitations, particularly the implications of representing topography and complex heterogeneous facades on a discrete Cartesian grid, and glass facades that are not fully represented in terms of radiative processes.  Our findings are able to validate the representation of physical processes in PALM while also pointing out specific shortcomings.

The role of blue and green infrastructure in thermal sensation in public urban areas: A case study of summer days in four Czech cities,"Thermal comfort in public spaces, as an important factor in the quality of life, has been strongly affected by manifestations of climate change. City authorities are under pressure to adapt their approaches to the urban environment. This study investigates thermal sensation in public spaces in four Czech cities. Biometeorological measurements were taken and biometeorological indices (UTCI, PET, HUMIDEX) established, then contrasted with questionnaire surveys (thermal sensation vote – TSV). Regression models were subsequently constructed to explore the influences of elements of blue and green infrastructure beyond their microclimatic functions. The results suggest a highly complex relationship between biometeorological indices and TSV in urban environments, significantly influenced by specificity of place and time. Open grassy areas exhibit a lower probability of higher TSV related to heat stress. Despite measured microclimatic effects that might indicate the opposite, the probability of TSV-related heat stress is higher under trees and near sprayed water-mist. The findings herein thus indicate that simple predicted mean vote models are of little or no use in urban planning, and that sensitive and sustainable planning of heat mitigation measures should reflect the behavioural patterns of citizens alongside the microclimatic effects in actual place.",50702.0,"Lehnert, Michal:Brabec, Marek:Jurek, Martin:Tokar, Vladimír:Geletič, Jan",Sustainable Cities and Society,2,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cancer Cells Microsurgery via Asymmetric Bent Surface Au/Ag/Ni Microrobotic Scalpels through a Transversal Rotating Magnetic Field,"The actuation of micro/nanomachines by means of a magnetic field is a promising fuel-free way to transport cargo in microscale dimensions.

CO2 gasification of biomass: The effect of lime concentration in a fluidised bed,"Fluidised bed (FB) technology can be advantageously used for the gasification of solid fuels. Calcined carbonate materials, such as limestone or dolomite, can be used directly in the fluidised bed of the gasification reactor to reform tars in situ and to enhance carbon conversion and cold gas efficiency of the gasification process. However, they exhibit poorer mechanical stability, they tend to be attrited and carried over from the reactor, and their catalytic activity decreases over time. Therefore, a portion of the material has to be replenished continuously or periodically. To decrease the amount of carbonate material that has to be replenished, a lower amount of lime (calcined limestone or dolomite) can be used in the FB, diluted by a mechanically robust material, such as silica sand or olivine. According to the literature, even concentrations in the order of 10–35% wt. of carbonate material in the FB of silica sand have a substantial effect on the decomposition of tars during steam or air gasification. However, the effect of the concentration of lime in the FB has not yet been described for CO2 gasification. In this paper, we focus on the effect of the ratio of calcined dolomitic limestone and silica sand in the FB (0%, 25%, 50% and 100% vol. of dolomitic limestone) for CO2+O2 gasification of biomass and compare it with H2O+O2 gasification at the temperature of 850 °C. The experiments were performed in a semi-autothermal spouting FB reactor, gasifying 1.4 kg h−1 of woody biomass. The effects of the concentration of dolomitic lime in the fluidised bed differed for H2O+O2 and CO2+O2 gasification. When gasifying with H2O+O2, optimal results were found with 50% vol. (35% wt.) lime in the FB, when the yield of tar was similar to the use of pure lime in the FB. When gasifying with CO2+O2, a substantial decrease in tar yield was observed when using 50% vol. (35% wt.) lime in the FB (compared to the use of pure silica sand), nevertheless, the use of undiluted lime in the FB remains the best option to attain minimal tar yield when gasifying with a CO2+O2 gasifying agent. In this case, the tar yield was decreased 8.7-fold, and the tar dew point was decreased by 124 °C (to 71 °C) compared to the non-catalysed case with silica sand being the fluidised bed of the gasifier. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",20704.0,"Jeremiáš, M.:Pohořelý, Michael:Svoboda, K.:Skoblia, Siarhei:Beňo, Zdeněk:Šyc, M.",Applied Energy,2,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1
Multistrata agroforestry as an alternative to slash-and-burn farming in the Peruvian Amazon,"One of the causes of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is slash-and-burn farming. As a viable alternative, we established and evaluated multistrata agroforestry systems around the town of Pucallpa (Ucayali region). Since 2007 till 2009, a total of 73 plots were established in nine villages, most of them on deforested and severely degraded soil. The system was based on cultivation of fast-growing indigenous fruit tree species Inga edulis as a key component, combined with other native fruit and timber trees. During early years of establishment, farmers intercrop trees with their own staple crops.

Who actually decides? Parental influence on the housing tenure choice of their children,"We focus on the role of within-family socialisation and the relationship between socialisation and resource transfers in the intergenerational transmission of housing preferences, the formation of familial housing attitudes and thus the reproduction of a normative housing tenure ladder across generations in Czech society. We show that resource transfers and the within-family socialisation of housing preferences, including preferences concerning housing tenure, are closely interconnected. In other words, parental influence on decision to buy own housing (and on housing preferences in general) of their adult children through socialisation is stronger if there is an (actual or assumed) intergenerational resource transfer. This has several implications for how housing markets and systems work.

Spam filtering using integrated distribution-based balancing approach and regularized deep neural networks,"Rapid growth in the volume of unsolicited and unwanted messages has inspired the development of many anti-spam methods. Supervised anti-spam filters using machine-learning methods have been particularly effective in categorizing spam and non-spam messages. These automatically integrate spam corpora pre-processing, appropriate word lists selection, and the calculation of word weights, usually in a bag-of-words fashion. To develop an accurate spam filter is challenging because spammers attempt to decrease the probability of spam detection by using legitimate words. Complex models are therefore needed to solve such a problem. However, existing spam filtering methods usually converge to a poor local minimum, cannot effectively handle high-dimensional data and suffer from overfitting issues. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel spam filter integrating an N-gram tf.idf feature selection, modified distribution-based balancing algorithm and a regularized deep multi-layer perceptron NN model with rectified linear units (DBB-RDNN-ReL). As demonstrated on four benchmark spam datasets (Enron, SpamAssassin, SMS spam collection and Social networking), the proposed approach enables capturing more complex features from high-dimensional data by additional layers of neurons. Another advantage of this approach is that no additional dimensionality reduction is necessary and spam dataset imbalance is addressed using a modified distribution-based algorithm. We compare the performance of the approach with that of state-of-the-art spam filters (Minimum Description Length, Factorial Design using SVM and NB, Incremental Learning C4.5, and Random Forest, Voting and Convolutional Neural Network) and several machine learning algorithms commonly used to classify text. We show that the proposed model outperforms these other methods in terms of classification accuracy, with fewer false negatives and false positives. Notably, the proposed spam filter classifies both major (legitimate) and minor (spam) classes well on personalized / non-personalized and balanced / imbalanced spam datasets. In addition, we show that the proposed model performs better than the results reported by previous studies in terms of accuracy. However, the high computational expenses related to additional hidden layers limit its application as an online spam filter and make it difficult to overcome the problem of concept drift.",10201.0,"Barushka, Aliaksandr:Hájek, Petr",Applied Intelligence,2,high,high,1,1,high,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
European merchant trading firms and the export of the precious metals from the Kingdom of Bohemia during the 16th century,"This study summarizes the results of basic research undertaken during the past decade that are not yet available to the broader scientific community. Chronologically it covers the period between 1516-1548, when the Kingdom of Bohemia (now Czech Republic, located in Central Europe) was the most significant source of supply of newly mined silver for the European market (i.e. prior to the inception in the 1540’s of the large-scale importation of silver from the Spanish mines in Central and South America). At that time Czech raw material resources were very familiar to international traders in precious metals and the struggle for access to the trade in Czech silver during that period had become an important aspect of the political rivalry in Central Europe. During those three decades, during which silver mining in the Czech area of the Ore Mountains and its export to the international market reached its highest level, five major power-business groupings became involved in the struggle for access to the trade in Czech silver: two major business groupings, in permanent association with a few commercial, financial and investor entities (South German and Saxon consortia), the two representatives of European rule (the Roman Emperor and the Czech King) together with the highly influential community of the Czech Estates, made up of the local nobility and the Royal Free Cities.",60101.0,"Vorel, Petr","Mercantilism, account keeping and the periphery-core relationship",2,low,low,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fast and Low-Temperature (70 °C) Mineralization of Inkjet Printed Mesoporous TiO2 Photoanodes Using Ambient Air Plasma,"ybrid mesoporous titania/silica electron-generating and transporting layers were prepared using wet-coating with a dispersion consisting of prefabricated titania nanoparticles and a methyl-silica binder. Titania/methyl-silica wet layers were deposited by inkjet printing and further mineralized by low-temperature atmospheric-pressure air plasma using diffuse coplanar surface barrier discharge (DCSBD) to form a titania/silica hybrid nanocomposite coating. Morphological analysis performed by scanning electron microscopy revealed no damage to the titania nanoparticles and chemical analysis performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy disclosed a rapid decrease in carbon and increase in oxygen, indicating the oxidation effect of the plasma. The coatings were further electrochemically investigated with linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The magnitude of photocurrent and photocatalytic activity were found to increase significantly with the plasma exposure on the order of 10s of seconds.

Social Normativism,"Normativity is one of the keywords of contemporary philosophical discussions Are the philosophers who argue for the irreducible role of normativity within accounts for human societies obliged to assume, as Stephen Turner has recently put it, the existence of a 'non-natural, non-empirical stuff that is claimed to be necessarily, intrinsically there and to in some sense account for the actual'? In this paper I argue that though paying due attention to the normative dimension of human societies is indeed indispensable for an adequate account of us humans as social beings, there is a way of grasping this dimension free of trafficking in any esoteric stuff. The peculiar status of this dimension stems from the fact that we simply cannot approach all rules and norms of our society 'from without': we are unable to extricate ourselves from the web of rules that constitutes the social space which by now forms our native niche. This does not mean that norms constitute a layer of reality elusive of scientific understanding, it does mean, however, that scientific understanding may need to involve – or be complemented by – an understanding of our societies’ normative scaffolds as seen from within.",0.0,"Peregrin, Jaroslav",Normativity and naturalism in the philosophy of social sciences,2,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Assessment of Model Uncertainties for Structural Resistance,"Uncertainties in resistance models play a significant role in the reliability analysis of structures and code calibration of partial factors for semi-probabilistic design. In spite of this importance, existing knowledge concerning model uncertainties and their characteristics seems to suffer from imprecise definitions and lack of available experimental data. Currently used probabilistic models and derived factors for model uncertainties are mostly based on intuitive judgements and limited data. This often leads to an unrealistic description of model uncertainties. The present study attempts to improve definitions of model uncertainties and proposes a general methodology for their quantification by comparing experimental and model results. It appears that model uncertainty should be always related to a specific model and scope of its application.

Beyond the classical thermodynamic contributions to hydrogen atom abstraction reactivity,"Hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactions are cornerstones of chemistry. Various (metallo)enzymes performing the HAA catalysis evolved in nature and inspired the rational development of multiple synthetic catalysts. Still, the factors determining their catalytic efficiency are not fully understood. Herein, we define the simple thermodynamic factor η by employing two thermodynamic cycles: one for an oxidant (catalyst), along with its reduced, protonated, and hydrogenated form, and one for the substrate, along with its oxidized, deprotonated, and dehydrogenated form. It is demonstrated that η reflects the propensity of the substrate and catalyst for (a)synchronicity in concerted H+/e- transfers. As such, it significantly contributes to the activation energies of the HAA reactions, in addition to a classical thermodynamic (Bell-Evans-Polanyi) effect. In an attempt to understand the physicochemical interpretation of η, we discovered an elegant link between η and reorganization energy λ from Marcus theory. We discovered computationally that for a homologous set of HAA reactions, λ reaches its maximum for the lowest |η|, which then corresponds to the most synchronous HAA mechanism. This immediately implies that among HAA processes with the same reaction free energy, ΔG0, the highest barrier (≡ΔG≠) is expected for the most synchronous proton-coupled electron (i.e., hydrogen) transfer. As proof of concept, redox and acidobasic properties of nonheme FeIVO complexes are correlated with activation free energies for HAA from C-H and O-H bonds. We believe that the reported findings may represent a powerful concept in designing new HAA catalysts.",10403.0,"Bím, Daniel:Maldonado-Domínguez, Mauricio:Rulíšek, L.:Srnec, Martin",Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United Stated of America,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The relationship between plant species richness and soil pH vanishes with increasing aridity across Eurasian dry grasslands.,"Aim Soil pH is considered an important driver of fine-scale plant species richness in terrestrial ecosystems. However, it is unclear to what extent this relationship is influenced by precipitation, which often directly affects both soil pH and species richness. We asked: (1) what is the relationship between fine-scale vascular plant species richness and soil pH in regions with different levels of precipitation and (2) what are the relative effects of soil pH and precipitation on species richness? Location Dry grasslands in eight regions of northern Eurasia. Methods Species richness and soil pH were measured in 1055 10 m × 10 m plots and precipitation values were derived from global datasets. Relationships between variables were explored using general linear models, mixed-effect models and partial regressions. Variation partitioning was used to assess the relative effect of each predictor on species richness. Results In wetter regions, soil pH range was broader, mean species richness was higher and the richness–pH relationship was unimodal. In drier regions, mean soil pH was higher and its range narrower, species richness was on average lower and less variable, and the richness–pH relationship was negative or absent. The richness–pH relationship persisted after controlling for the effect of precipitation, but precipitation, uniquely or together with soil pH, explained more variation in species richness in most regions than did pH alone. Main conclusions The relationship between plant species richness and soil pH in dry grasslands changes from unimodal, through negative, to none with decreasing regional precipitation in Eurasia. However, it seems that the species richness–soil pH relationship in dry grasslands over broad areas is substantially influenced and confounded by precipitation either indirectly, by shortening and shifting the pH gradient, or directly, by decreasing the negative effects of drought stress on richness.",10600.0,"Palpurina, Salza:Wagner, Viktoria:von Wehrden, Henrik:Hájek, Michal:Horsák, Michal:Brinkert, Annika:Hölzel, Norbert:Wesche, Karsten:Kamp, Johannes:Hájková, Petra:Danihelka, Jiří:Lustyk, Pavel:Merunková, Kristina:Preislerová, Zdenka:Kočí, Martin:Kubešová, Svatava:Cherosov, Mikhail:Ermakov, Nikolai:German, Dmitry A.:Gogoleva, Paraskovia:Lashchinsky, Nikolai:Martynenko, Vassiliy:Chytrý, Milan",Global Ecology and Biogeography,2,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Land of Apparitions: The Depiction of Ghosts and Other Supernatural Occurrences in the First Gothic Plays,"The paper discusses one of the key features of the genre of gothic drama which reigned over the English stage during the latter part of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The gothic stage represented the psyche of the eighteenth century audience, namely their special delight in “exploiting mystery, gloom and terror”, as Bertrand Evans put it. Gothic dramatists strived to promote this prevailing public taste. Strong links between gothic drama and the gothic novel have been observed by many scholars. The gothic romances served as a source for playwrights and the detailed visual backgrounds were helpful in creating settings for the plays. Gothic novels were very often adapted for the stage.

Acidic pH Is Required for the Multilamellar Assembly of Skin Barrier Lipids In Vitro,"Lipid membrane remodeling belongs to the most fundamental processes in the body. The skin barrier lipids, which are ceramide dominant and highly rigid, must attain an unusual multilamellar nanostructure with long periodicity to restrict water loss and prevent the entry of potentially harmful environmental factors. Our data suggest that the skin acid mantle, apart from regulating enzyme activities and keeping away pathogens, may also be a prerequisite for the multilamellar assembly of the skin barrier lipids. Atomic force microscopy on monolayers composed of synthetic or human stratum corneum lipids showed multilayer formation (approximately 10-nm step height) in an acidic but not in a neutral environment. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and permeability studies showed markedly altered lipid nanostructure and increased water loss at neutral pH compared with that at acidic pH.

Imaging in gynecological disease (19): clinical and ultrasound features of extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (eGIST),"Objective: To describe the clinical and sonographic characteristics of extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (eGISTs). Methods: This was a retrospective multicenter study. The data of patients with a histological diagnosis of eGIST who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination were retrieved from the databases of nine large European gynecologic oncology centers. One investigator from each center reviewed stored images and ultrasound reports, and described the lesions using the terminology of the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis and Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment groups, following a predefined ultrasound evaluation form. Clinical, surgical and pathological information was also recorded. Results: Thirty-five women with an eGIST were identified, in 17 cases, the findings were incidental, and 18 cases were symptomatic. Median age was 57 years (range, 21-85 years). Tumor marker CA 125 was available in 23 (65.7%) patients, with a median level of 23 U/mL (range, 7-403 U/mL). The vast majority of eGISTs were intraperitoneal lesions (n = 32 (91.4%)), the remaining lesions were retroperitoneal (n = 2 (5.7%)) or preperitoneal (n = 1 (2.9%)). The most common site of the tumor was the abdomen (n = 23 (65.7%)), and less frequently the pelvis (n = 12 (34.3%)). eGISTs were typically large (median largest diameter, 79 mm) solid (n = 31 (88.6%)) tumors, and were less frequently multilocular-solid tumors (n = 4 (11.4%)). The echogenicity of solid tumors was uniform in 8/31 (25.8%) cases, which were all hypoechogenic. Twenty-three solid eGISTs were non-uniform, either with mixed echogenicity (9/23 (39.1%)) or with cystic areas (14/23 (60.9%)). The tumor shape was mainly lobular (n = 19 (54.3%)) or irregular (n = 10 (28.6%)). Tumors were typically richly vascularized (color score of 3 or 4, n = 31 (88.6%)) with no shadowing (n = 31 (88.6%)). Based on pattern recognition, eGISTs were usually correctly classified as a malignant lesion in the ultrasound reports (n = 32 (91.4%)), and the specific diagnosis of eGIST was the most frequent differential diagnosis (n = 16 (45.7%)), followed by primary ovarian cancer (n = 5 (14.3%)), lymphoma (n = 2 (5.7%)) and pedunculated uterine fibroid (n = 2 (5.7%)). Conclusions: On ultrasound, eGISTs were usually solid, non-uniform pelvic or abdominal lobular tumors of mixed echogenicity, with or without cystic areas, with rich vascularization and no shadowing.

Evaluation of major heat waves’ mechanisms in EURO-CORDEX RCMs over Central Europe,"The main aim of the study is to evaluate the capability of EURO-CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs) to simulate major heat waves in Central Europe and their associated meteorological factors. Three reference major heat waves (1994, 2006, and 2015) were identified in the E-OBS gridded data set, based on their temperature characteristics, length and spatial extent. Atmospheric circulation, precipitation, net shortwave radiation, and evaporative fraction anomalies during these events were assessed using the ERA-Interim reanalysis. The analogous major heat waves and their links to the aforementioned factors were analysed in an ensemble of EURO-CORDEX RCMs driven by various global climate models in the 1970–2016 period. All three reference major heat waves were associated with favourable circulation conditions, precipitation deficit, reduced evaporative fraction and increased net shortwave radiation. This joint contribution of large-scale circulation and land–atmosphere interactions is simulated with difficulties in majority of the RCMs, which affects the magnitude of modelled major heat waves. In some cases, the seemingly good reproduction of major heat waves’ magnitude is erroneously achieved through extremely favourable circulation conditions compensated by a substantial surplus of soil moisture or vice versa. These findings point to different driving mechanisms of major heat waves in some RCMs compared to observations, which should be taken into account when analysing and interpreting future projections of these events.",10509.0,"Lhotka, Ondřej:Kyselý, Jan:Plavcová, Eva",Climate Dynamics,2,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bilirubin: The yellow hormone?,"Bilirubin is a tetrapyrrolic compound originating from heme catabolism.

Bilirubin appears to have versatile functions, from cell signaling (behaving almost like a &quot,real&quot, hormonal substance), modulation of metabolism, to immune regulation, affecting biological activities with apparent clinical and even therapeutic consequences. These activities may be the reason for the lower incidence of diseases of civilisation (cardiovascular diseases, arterial hypertension, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, certain cancers, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases) observed in individuals with a chronic mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, a typical sign of Gilbert&apos,s syndrome.

Connecting the ambitwistor and the sectorized heterotic strings,"The sectorized description of the (chiral) heterotic string using pure spinors has been misleadingly viewed as an infinite tension string. One evidence for this fact comes from the tree level 3-point graviton amplitude, which we show to contain the usual Einstein term plus a higher curvature contribution. After reintroducing a dimensionful parameter ℓ in the theory, we demonstrate that the heterotic model is in fact two-fold, depending on the choice of the supersymmetric sector, and that the spectrum also contains one massive (open string like) multiplet.

Reductively degradable poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogels with oriented porosity for tissue engineering applications,"Degradable poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogels were prepared from a linear copolymer (Mw = 49 kDa) of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), 2-(acethylthio)ethyl methacrylate (ATEMA), and zwitterionic 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC). The deprotection of ATEMA thiol groups by triethylamine followed by their gentle oxidation with 2,2´-dithiodipyridine resulted in the formation of reductively degradable polymers with disulfide bridges. Finally, a hydrogel 3D structure with an oriented porosity was obtained by gelation of the polymer in the presence of needle-like sodium acetate crystals. The pore diameter and porosity of resulting poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-2-(acethylthio)ethyl methacrylate-co-2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) [P(HEMA-ATEMA-MPC)] hydrogels varied between 59 and 65 mu m and between 70 and 79.6 vol % according to Hg porosimetry, and complete degradation of these materials was reached in 86 days in 0.33 mmol solution of l-cysteine/L in phosphate buffer. The cross-linked P(HEMA-ATEMA-MPC) hydrogels were evaluated as a possible support for human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

Micromechanical characterization and modeling of cement pastes containing waste marble powder,"A comprehensive study consisting of a microstructure investigation, nanoindentation, and micromechanical modeling was performed to identify phases and assess their impact on macroscopic properties of cement pastes containing waste marble powder. The proposed model, built on the Mori-Tanaka scheme, was used to estimate the effective Young's modulus and compressive strength at a low computational cost. After model validation, the effects of an interfacial transition zone (ITZ) and increased porosity of marble powder rich-pastes were quantified. The study revealed a fundamental role of the ITZ formed around stiff marble powder inclusions, responsible for performance deterioration. These findings indicate that elimination of the ITZ and reduction of porosity would considerably enhance the strength of cement-based materials containing waste marble powder. As a consequence, larger amounts of waste marble could be incorporated as a cement replacement without sacrificing structural performance.",20101.0,"Nežerka, Václav:Hrbek, Vladimír:Prošek, Zdeněk:Somr, Michael:Tesárek, Pavel:Fládr, Josef",Journal of Cleaner Production,2,high,high,0,1,high,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Live Birth Following Uterine Transplantation From a Nulliparous Deceased Donor,"BACKGROUND: Nulliparous uterine grafts have never been used in uterus transplantation (UTx), possibly due to presumed infertility. Our objective was to verify the feasibility of nulliparous uterine graft transplantation. METHODS: The Czech Uterus Transplant Trial (registered under ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03277430) is a 2-arm trial comparing the efficacy of deceased donor (DD) versus live-donor uterus transplant (10 patients in both arms). A 25-year-old patient suffering from inborn absolute uterine factor infertility underwent a DD uterus transplant. The donor was a 20-year-old nulliparous brain-dead donor. RESULTS: The transplant procedure was uneventful. The posttransplant period was complicated by (1) recurrent episodes of acute cellular rejection, (2) neutropenia necessitating the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, (3) vaginal anastomotic stenosis treated with the insertion of a self-expanding stent, (4) the concurrence of Clostridium difficile colitis and acute appendicitis, and (5) temporary renal function impairment of a combined cause. Two years after the UTx, after the fourth embryo transfer, the patient became pregnant. Apart from gestational diabetes mellitus, the pregnancy was uneventful. Due to preterm contractions, delivery was achieved via caesarean section at gestational age 34 + 6 years. The postoperative course was uneventful for both the mother and the newborn. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report the first live birth after a DD UTx in Europe. This report provides a proof of concept that nulliparous uteri may present a suitable source of uterine grafts for UTx. Stenting may serve as a feasible treatment method for vaginal anastomotic stenosis.",30213.0,"Froněk, Jiří:Janoušek, Libor:Křístek, Jakub:Chlupáč, Jaroslav:Pluta, Marek:Novotný, Róbert:Malušková, Jana:Olausson, Michael",Transplantation,2,high,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Simultaneous optical and electrochemical label-free biosensing with ITO-coated lossy-mode resonance sensor,"In this work we discuss a new label-free biosensing device based on indium tin oxide (ITO) overlaid section of a multimode optical fiber fused silica core. The sensor has been used to optical measurements also simultaneously interrogated electrochemically (EC). Due to optimized thickness and optical properties of ITO film, a lossy-mode resonance (LMR) could be observed in the optical domain, where electrical properties of the film allowed for application of the sensor as a working electrode in an EC setup. It has been confirmed that the LMR response depends on optical properties of the external medium, as well as potential applied to the electrode during cyclic voltammetry. After the ITO surface functionalization with amine groups and covalently attached biotin, the device has been applied for label-free biosensing of avidin in both the domains simultaneously. On the example of biotin-avidin detection system it was demonstrated that when avidin concentration increases a decrease in current and increase in LMR wavelength shift were recorded in EC and optical domain, respectively. Both optical and EC responses follow the protein interaction process, and thus can be used as cross-verification of the readouts. Moreover, an extended information has been achieved comparing to solely EC interrogation, i.e., the grafting process of biotin and avidin was directly monitored optically displaying individual steps of an incubation procedure.",10306.0,"Smietana, Mateusz:Koba, Marcin:Sezemský, Petr:Szot-Karpinska, Katarzyna:Burnat, Dariusz:Straňák, Vítězslav:Niedziolka-Jonsson, Joanna:Bogdanowicz, Robert",Biosensors and Bioelectronics,2,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Brilliant gamma-ray beam and electron-positron pair production by enhanced attosecond pulses,"Electron–positron pair production via Breit–Wheeler process requires laser intensities approaching 1024 W cm−2 due to the small cross-section. Here, we propose a mechanism for brilliant γ-ray emission and dense GeV pairs creation accompanied with high-harmonic generation by using plasma mirror and an ultra short pulse with the intensity of 3 × 1023 W cm−2. The laser is reflected by the solid surface after propagating tens of microns in a near-critical density plasma and breaks into short wave packets. The intensity of the reflected high order harmonic field is enhanced by the focusing and compression effects from the deformed oscillating mirror. The radiation trapped electrons emit γ-photons while colliding with the reflected attosecond pulses. The peak intensity of the γ-ray reaches 0.74 PW with the brilliance of 2 × 1024 s−1 mm−2 mrad−2 (0.1%BW)−1 (at 58 MeV).",10305.0,"Gu, Yanjun:Klimo, Ondřej:Bulanov, Sergey V.:Weber, Stefan A.",COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS,2,high,high,1,1,medium,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Windstorms and forest disturbances in the Czech Lands: 1801–2015,"The long-term relationship between windstorms and forest disturbances in the Czech Lands is analysed in this paper, covering a very long period of 215 years (1801-2015). Based on documentary evidence and instrumental records, long-term series of severe windstorms in the summer half-year (April September) and in the winter half year (October March) are compiled. Severe windstorms were more frequent in the 1820s-1840s, 1900s-1930s, and 1960s-2000s, less so in the latter half of the 19th century and in the 1940s-1950s. Their long-term variability is revealed with three differently-created series of forest damage for the periods of 1801-1900, 1900-1980 and 1963-2015. Based on these comparisons, 14 windstorms that did outstanding damage to forests are selected: 12 occurred in the winter half-year and two in July. They are further investigated with respect to their meteorological character and the damage done. In this sample, the high-impact winter half-year windstorms are typically related to very distinct ( > 45 hPa) pressure gradients between low pressure systems over the North/Norwegian Sea and high pressure systems south-west of the Iberian Peninsula, which exhibits an eastward-shifted and tilted NAO pattern, inducing the passage of frontal waves across the Czech Lands. High temperatures arising from south-westerly airflow and wet ground before windstorms provided conditions conducive to extensive windthrow in forests, sometimes with damage exacerbated by subsequent bark-beetle calamities. The increase in windstorms with outstanding forest damage after 1950 may be attributed in part to the negative consequences of forest management that prioritises high, short-term profits over ecological well-being.",10611.0,"Brázdil, Rudolf:Stucki, P.:Szabó, Péter:Řezníčková, Ladislava:Dolák, Lukáš:Dobrovolný, Petr:Tolasz, R.:Kotyza, O.:Chromá, Kateřina:Suchánková, Silvie",Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"SGIP1 is involved in regulation of emotionality, mood, and nociception and modulates in vivo signalling of cannabinoid CB1 receptors","Background and Purpose Src homology 3-domain growth factor receptor-bound 2-like endophilin interacting protein 1 (SGIP1) interacts with cannabinoid CB1 receptors. SGIP1 is abundantly and principally expressed within the nervous system. SGIP1 and CB1 receptors co-localize in axons and presynaptic boutons. SGIP1 interferes with the internalization of activated CB1 receptors in transfected heterologous cells. Consequently, the transient association of CB1 receptors with beta-arrestin2 is enhanced and prolonged, and CB1 receptor-mediated ERK1/2 signalling is decreased. Because of these actions, SGIP1 may modulate affect, anxiety, pain processing, and other physiological processes controlled by the endocannabinoid system (ECS).",10608.0,"Dvořáková, Michaela:Kubik-Zahorodna, Agnieszka:Straiker, A.:Sedláček, Radislav:Hájková, Alena:Mackie, K.:Blahoš, Jaroslav",British Journal of Pharmacology,2,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Progress and prospects in reverse electrodialysis for salinity gradient energy conversion and storage,"Salinity gradient energy is currently attracting growing attention among the scientific community as a renewable energy source. In particular, Reverse Electrodialysis (RED) is emerging as one of the most promising membrane-based technologies for renewable energy generation by mixing two solutions of different salinity. This work presents a critical review of the most significant achievements in RED, focusing on membrane development, stack design, fluid dynamics, process optimization, fouling and potential applications. Although RED technology is mainly investigated for energy generation from river water/seawater, the opportunities for the use of concentrated brine are considered as well, driven by benefits in terms of higher power density and mitigation of adverse environmental effects related to brine disposal. Interesting extensions of the applicability of RED for sustainable production of water and hydrogen when complemented by reverse osmosis, membrane distillation, bio-electrochemical systems and water electrolysis technologies are also discussed, along with the possibility to use it as an energy storage device. The main hurdles to market implementation, predominantly related to unavailability of high performance, stable and low-cost membrane materials, are outlined.

HPMA-based star polymer biomaterials with tuneable structure and biodegradability tailored for advanced drug delivery to solid tumours,"Design, controlled synthesis, physico-chemical and biological characteristics of novel well-defined biodegradable star-shaped copolymers intended for advanced drug delivery is described. These new biocompatible star copolymers were synthesised by grafting monodispersed semitelechelic linear (sL) N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers onto a 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (bisMPA)-based polyester dendritic core of various structures. The hydrodynamic diameter of the star copolymer biomaterials can be tuned from 13 to 31 nm and could be adjusted to a given purpose by proper selection of the bisMPA dendritic core type and generation and by considering the sL copolymer molecular weight and polymer-to-core molar ratio. The hydrolytic degradation was proved for both the star copolymers containing either dendron or dendrimer core, showing the spontaneous hydrolysis in duration of few weeks. Finally, it was shown that the therapy with the biodegradable star conjugate with attached doxorubicin strongly suppresses the tumour growth in mice and is fully curative in most of the treated animals at dose corresponding approximately to one fourth of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) value.

Definability of satisfaction in outer models,"Let M be a transitive model of ZFC. We say that a transitive model of ZFC, N , is an outer model of M if M is a subset of N and the ordinals coincide. The outer model theory of M is the collection of all formulas with parameters from M which hold in all outer models of M (which exist in a universe in which M is countable, this is independent of the choice of such a universe). Satisfaction defined with respect to outer models can be seen as a useful strengthening of first-order logic. Starting from an inaccessible cardinal κ, we show that it is consistent to have a transitive model M of ZFC of size κ in which the outer model theory is lightface definable, and moreover M satisfies V = HOD. The proof combines the infinitary logic L_infinity, omega, Barwise's results on admissible sets, and a new forcing iteration of length strictly less than κ+ which manipulates the continuum function on certain regular cardinals below κ.

Photocatalytic abatement of NOx pollutants in the air using commercial functional coating with porous morphology,"Titanium dioxide is the most important photocatalyst used for purifying applications. The purpose of this study was to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the commercial product Protectam FN2, containing Evonik P25 titanium dioxide nanopowder, with regard to NO and NO2 abatement. Photocatalytic experiments on the photocatalytic coatings on concrete and plaster substrates were carried out in two types of flow reactors, namely one with laminar flow and another with ideally-mixed flow, under „real world conditions“ of temperature, relative humidity, irradiation intensity and pollutant concentrations. The results showed that the photocatalytic process significantly reduced the concentration of both nitrogen oxides in the air. The reaction rate, i.e., the decrease in the concentration of NOx achieved in the steady-state for the inlet concentration of NO and NO2 of 0.1 ppmv, which corresponds to highly polluted urban air, was up to 75 and 50 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), respectively, at the flow rate of 3000 cm(3) min(-1) and relative humidity of 50%.

Strain monitoring of active faults in the central Apennines (Italy) during the period 2002-2017,"We present the results of 3-D monitoring of strain along active faults outcropping in the central Apennines, where recent and historical strong earthquakes occurred, using TM-71 extensometers during the period 2002-2017. We discuss the fault slip development as well as kinematics particularly in the light of local recent seismicity. The recorded fault slip corresponds to the minimum and maximum principal stress with a SW-NE orientation and slightly dipping to SW. Moreover, the detected fault slip is non-linear and affected by remarkable transient periods of acceleration, which lasted up to several months. The recorded accelerations were induced by alternation of extensional, reverse and horizontal displacement due to switching extensional and compressional stress/strain state and coincide with periods of major seismic events that recently affected the central Apennines. This phenomenon is being investigated.

Online Comments as a Tool of Intercultural (Russian–Czech) “Anti-Dialog”,"This study presents a content and qualitative discourse analysis of readers’ comments made on Czech journalism on sociopolitical topics published in Russian translation at InoSMI.ru. Following the tradition of ethnomethodology, which examines the formation of subjective views of the world from the viewpoint of the general population, the interpretation of the examined discourse focuses on analyzing the verbal attitudes of regular Russian readers of political journalism toward the opinions of the Czech public on the current-day Russia and toward Czechs and the Czech Republic in general. Specifically, the study examined the expressions of intolerance toward the opinions of others and linguistic aggression on the part of the Russian-speaking commenters toward the authors of critical Czech journalism as natural and instinctive dismissive reactions to “different” or hostile language and cultural and ideological expressions. The study is based on language data acquired by analyzing readers’ comments left on a total of 45 Russian translations of Czech journalistic writings published between January and September 2016 on 12 different Czech websites. The qualitative, critical analysis of the linguistic material is based on a sociocognitive approach, which assumes a dialectical relationship between the discourse and society operating through cognitive structures (knowledge and ideology). The aim of this study was to highlight the negative aspects of unsanctioned public sociopolitical discourse, which is currently made possible and accelerated by technology advances of the Internet network and, at a time of a de facto information war, contributes to the spread of negativistic and hostile attitudes and sentiments, rather than to a genuine intercultural dialog.",60206.0,"Gazda, Jiří","Journal of Nationalism, Memory & Language Politics",2,medium,high,1,0,high,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Wheel-rail creep force model for predicting water induced low adhesion phenomena,A computationally efficient engineering model to predict adhesion in rolling contact in the presence of water is presented which may be implemented in multibody dynamics software or in railway vehicle braking models. This model has been developed in a project funded by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) and Network Rail. It is referred to as the water-induced low adhesion creep force (WILAC) model. The model covers a wide range of conditions from dry over damp to wet. Special emphasis is put on little amounts of water which can cause low adhesion without any oil or grease. Such conditions may be encountered in humid weather or at the onset of rain. The model is parameterised based on experimental results from a tram wheel test rig. Adhesion values as low as 0.06 are observed at high creep with only wear debris and little water present in the contact. The model results also agree with experimental data from locomotive tests in dry and wet conditions.,20104.0,"Trummer, Gerald:Buckley-Johnstone, Luke:Voltr, Petr:Meierhofer, Alexander:Lewis, Roger:Six, Klaus",Tribology International,2,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Personal identity and the otherness of one's own body,"Locke claims that a person&apos,s identity over time consists in the unity of consciousness, not in the sameness of the body. Similarly, the phenomenological approach refuses to see the criteria of identity as residing in some externally observable bodily features. Nevertheless, it does not accept the idea that personal identity has to consist either in consciousness or in the body. We are self-aware as bodily beings. After providing a brief reassessment of Locke and the post-Lockean discussion, the article draws on phenomenological arguments that show the body as lived, that is, lived as one&apos,s own body, but also possibly as &quot,other&quot, or &quot,strange.&quot, Against what has been claimed in recent writing, especially in literature on Merleau-Ponty, the author argues that the &quot,mineness&quot, of the body and its &quot,alterity&quot, are not two mutually exclusive features.

What do Residents Consider to be Gambling and What are Their Attitudes Towards it? Evidence from the Czech Republic,"The aim of the article is to contribute to an understanding of the attitudes of post-communist Europe’s inhabitants towards gambling, and of their opinions concerning which activities can be regarded as gambling. The Attitudes Towards Gambling Scale (ATGS-8) questionnaire was used in the survey, ensuring the international comparability of the results. For the subsequent in-depth analysis of attitudes we mainly used multidimensional statistical methods. The survey, conducted in 2017, had 1092 respondents. The least negative attitudes to gambling were found in the younger age groups, while the attitudes of senior citizens were the most negative. Concerning participation in gambling, 68.4% of the respondents had taken part in at least one of the range of gambling activities offered as choices. Participation in gambling is an important factor influencing the overall attitude of the respondents to gambling. Of equal importance was the range of intensity in their perceptions of which games can be considered to be gambling, with four similarly perceived types of gambling identified. The research shows that gambling is perceived negatively by the population of the Czech Republic. The explanation may be found in the substantial media coverage of gambling related to changes in the legislation and the tightening of restrictions.",30312.0,"Fiedor, David:Král, Ondřej:Frajer, Jindřich:Šerý, Miloslav:Szczyrba, Zdeněk",JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES,2,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Physcomitrella patens exocyst subunit EXO70.3d has distinct roles in growth and development, and is essential for completion of the moss life cycle","The exocyst, an evolutionarily conserved secretory vesicle-tethering complex, spatially controls exocytosis and membrane turnover in fungi, metazoans and plants. The exocyst subunit EXO70 exists in multiple paralogs in land plants, forming three conserved clades with assumed distinct roles. Here we report functional analysis of the first moss exocyst subunit to be studied, Physcomitrella patens PpEXO70.3d (Pp1s97_91V6), from the, as yet, poorly characterized EXO70.3 clade. Following phylogenetic analysis to confirm the presence of three ancestral land plant EXO70 clades outside angiosperms, we prepared and phenotypically characterized loss-of-function Ppexo70.3d mutants and localized PpEXO70.3d in vivo using green fluorescent protein-tagged protein expression. Disruption of PpEXO70.3d caused pleiotropic cell elongation and differentiation defects in protonemata, altered response towards exogenous auxin, increased endogenous IAA concentrations, along with defects in bud and gametophore development. During mid-archegonia development, an abnormal egg cell is formed and subsequently collapses, resulting in mutant sterility. Mutants exhibited altered cell wall and cuticle deposition, as well as compromised cytokinesis, consistent with the protein localization to the cell plate. Despite some functional redundancy allowing survival of moss lacking PpEXO70.3d, this subunit has an essential role in the moss life cycle, indicating sub-functionalization within the moss EXO70 family.",10611.0,"Rawat, Anamika:Brejšková, Lucie:Hála, Michal:Cvrčková, F.:Žárský, Viktor",New Phytologist,2,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

By integrating sensitivity analysis at designer-specified tolerance levels and Pareto optimality, RODES produces designs that are potentially slightly suboptimal in return for less sensitivity-an acceptable trade-off in engineering practice.

Decision-making Process Using Hyperstructures and Fuzzy Structures in Social Sciences,"Algebraic hyperstructures represent an interesting field of algebra, important both from the theoretical point of view and also for their applications. A hypergroupoid structure can be associated with any social relationship. These hypergroupoids become hypergroups in some particular conditions, among them a condition concerning outer individuals. By analyzing it we can establish in a natural way when social relationships become optimal. The relations among persons are one of the bases of Social Sciences that usually are described by linguistic  propositions. If U is a set of individuals (the universe set to consider), usually it is not possible to affirm that for an ordered pair (x, y) of persons belonging to U a relation R given in a linguistic form holds or not, as happens in a binary context.

Machiavelli against the Venice myth : a sixteenth-century dialogue on the nature of political representation,"The established reading of the political history of the Italian Renaissance suggests that Florentine political theory and praxis were among the key sources of modern democracy. Proponents of this reading believe that Florentines acknowledged certain key political values constitutive of modern democracy, such as freedom of speech, equality before the law, free access to public offi ces, active citizenship, and so on. Some scholars - above all, members of the so-called Cambridge School - even recommend classical republicanism as a panacea to the ills of Western democracies. Under severe criticism in recent works of many commentators, this optimistic view has been revised. Many scholars no longer understand republican Florence as a democratic regime built on citizens&apos, equality, participation and representation. Instead of celebrating the birth of democracy, they show a wholly different picture of the republican regime - a triumph of oligarchy and elitist republicanism that has nothing, or almost nothing, in common with democracy.",50601.0,"Bíba, Jan",The Constructivist Turn in Political Representation,3,low,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mediation of young children’s digital technology use : The parents’ perspective,"The present-day reality that young children use digital media has forced parents to balance the risks and opportunities of the content that their children may encounter online. Current studies have mostly been quantitative. They have mainly focused on children aged 9 and older, and have addressed the types of mediation that parents use. However, they have not considered their relation to specific risks and opportunities. In the present study, we have sought to address this discrepancy and to understand the mediation strategies that parents use to shape the online experiences of their children. We focused on the factors that play a role in these mediations of specific risks and opportunities. In-depth semi-structured interviews with the parents of children aged 7–8 and their siblings in the Czech Republic (N=10 families) were conducted in 2014. A thematic analysis identified three main themes: (1) Mediation strategies of technology usage in relation to the mediation of online opportunities and online risks, (2) Time and place management of mediation strategies, and (3) The child as a co-creator of mediation strategies.

Agreement and Accuracy of National Stereotypes in Five Central European Countries,"In the chapter, we provide an overview of the current research on the accuracy of national stereotypes and introduce results of a research project on national stereotypes in five Central European countries. National stereotypes were operationalized as personality traits of typical country representatives. In Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia, we measured stereotypes from ingroup as well as outgroup perspectives. Each typical country representative was rated by people from the same country as well as from the other countries in the central European region. The main goal of our research was to compare both ingroup- and outgroup stereotypes with personality traits of real people living in the given countries to estimate if national stereotypes are accurate. Our results showed an agreement between Czech university students and Czech adults with different education level in their perception of Czech national stereotype and national stereotypes of other four countries, indicating stability of national ingroup stereotypes in time. The comparison of national ingroup stereotypes from the five central European countries resulted in a significant agreement between Czechs and Poles, Austrians and Germans, Czechs and Austrians, as well as Austrians and Poles. We found a good agreement among raters from different countries in their view on typical representatives of other countries – meaning that national stereotypes of a certain country rated from an outgroup perspective converge. National ingroup stereotype agreed with national outgroup stereotypes only in case of a typical German. The main finding of our research is that neither national ingroup stereotypes nor outgroup stereotypes correspond to personality traits of real people living in the given countries, indicating that national stereotypes are not accurate.",0.0,"Hřebíčková, Martina:Graf, Sylvie","Stereotypes and Stereotyping: Misperceptions, Perspectives and Role of Social Media",3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Permeation and sorption properties of CO2-selective blend membranes based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIM] [DCA]) ionic liquid for effective CO2/H-2 separation,"This paper reports on the preparation and testing of blend membranes based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIM] [DCA]) ionic liquid (IL) for effective CO2/H-2 gas separation. Stable membranes with 9, 14, 24, 42 and 53 wt.% of IL were prepared via the solution casting procedure. Structural analysis (XRD, Raman, TGA and DSC) revealed that the increase of the incorporated IL content in PVA affected e.g. crystalline orientation in the diffraction plane 1 0 1 in favour of plane 2 0 0. The presence of the IL shifted the Tg (65 degrees C) and Tm (165 degrees C) of neat PVA to lower temperatures, towards the values of pure IL. The gas transport in neat PVA and PVA-IL blends with low IL content was found to be diffusivity-controlled, and the IL addition leads to an increase of both gas permeability and H-2/CO2 selectivity. Instead, membranes with an IL content above 20 wt.% were more permeable for CO2 due to the prevailing solubility-controlled mechanism. Compared to neat PVA, which has barrier properties, the sample PVA-IL with 53 wt.% of IL exhibited an exceptional increase in gas permeability for both gases, H-2 circa 150 times to 8.65 Barrer and CO2 permeability circa 2400 times to 66.9 Barrer, with the corresponding ideal CO2/H-2 selectivity of 7.73 that slightly exceeds the reverse CO2/H-2 Robeson 2008 upper bound.",10404.0,"Klepić, Martina:Setnickova, Katerina:Lanč, Marek:Žák, Michal:Izák, Pavel:Dendisová, Marcela:Fuoco, Alessio:Jansen, Johannes C:Friess, Karel",Journal of Membrane Science,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

True Truffle Horst Diversity,"The host concept in true truffles (Tuber spp.) symbiosis is discussed in connection with ecophysiology of the fungus, and the ranges of hosts observed with different Tuber spp. are mentioned. Though the symbiotic status of some Tuber spp. is generally accepted, some other species most probably possess the ability to exploit soil organic matter. This is supported by the existence of genes coding for hydrolytic enzymes found in their genomes and by the scarcity or absence of ectomycorrhizae in some species. Tuber spp. may interact with non-host herbaceous plants, causing damage of the root tissues due to production of allelopathic compounds or can behave as comensals.

Influence of the heating rate on grain size of alumina ceramics prepared via spark plasma sintering (SPS),"The dependence of grain size on the heating rate has been investigated for alumina ceramics prepared via spark plasma sintering (SPS). For this purpose, the local grain size has been determined via position-dependent microscopic image analysis, using two independent grain size measures (mean chord length and Jeffries grain size). For alumina ceramics prepared with heating rates between 5 and 100 degrees C/min (pressure 80 MPa, maximum temperature 1300 degrees C) it is found that for higher heating rates the grain size is smaller. However, the microstructural non-uniformity is so large that any grain size determination that does not take this non-uniformity into account becomes meaningless, because grain size gradients from the specimen periphery to the center are larger than the differences in grain size due to different heating rates. Temperature and pressure gradients are discussed as the most plausible reasons for the microstructural non-uniformity.",20504.0,"Nečina, Vojtěch:Pabst, Willi",Journal of the European Ceramic Society,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

POD-DEIM based model order reduction for speed-up of flow parametric studies,"The model order reduction (MOR) is a useful tool for accelerating calculations connected to parametric studies or optimizations of complex systems. In this paper, we provide a MOR method directly applicable to industrial scale problems. We consider a posteriori MOR based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with Galerkin projection. The problems arising from the nonlinearities in the original model are addressed within the framework of the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The reduced order model (ROM) construction is newly implemented as a part of the open-source OpenFOAM CFD library. The new implementation is validated on a number of small scale tests and applied to a real-life problem of acceleration of a parametric study of flow in a complex geometry of an absorption column. Based on our tests, the application of reduced order model as a predictor for standard SIMPLE solution can speed-up the solution approximately two-fold.

The Demand Side of Negativity and Privatization in News : Experimental Study of News Consumer Habits,"Negativity in media and emphasis on personal side of politics are often cited as a common journalist practice which is harmful to democratic processes. Journalists and media houses are often held accountable for these phenomena because they prioritize profit over the quality of content. However, we offer an analysis focused on demand side of both negativity and privatization of political news. Using the Dynamic Process Tracing Environment (DPTE), we test the assumption that both of these features of political media coverage may be driven by audience demand for negative and personal news. According to the available literature, personal news can serve as a useful heuristics in citizens’ political judgment. We have confirmed a negativity bias, however, a tendency to select news about politicians’ private affairs was not confirmed. Even though respondents preferred political news, personal news showed to be more memorable, which might have further implications for formation of political attitudes.",50601.0,"Hrbková, Lenka:Zagrapan, Jozef:Chytilek, Roman",Mathematical-Statistical Models and Qualitative Theories for Economic and Social Sciences,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Composition and Antimicrobial Activity of the Essential Oil, Distilled Aromatic Water and Herbal Infusion from Epilobium parviflorum Schreb.","The essential oil of dry leaves and stems of Epilobium parviflorum Schreb. was obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger apparatus, for 5 h with a 0.02% (w/w) yield. The qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of its hexane extract by GC-FID and GC–MS showed the presence of 216 components and 123 constituents accounting for almost 94% of the oil were identified. GC–MS analysis revealed that the essential oil predominantly contains palmitic acid (30.8%), linoleic acid (12.5%) and α-linolenic acid (10.8%) as its major constituents. Analysis of aromatic water remained after hydrodistillation was performed, the main constituents were a group of monoterpenoids (38.9%). The antimicrobial activity of the distilled essential oil and the remaining aromatic water was evaluated against five microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans) using microdilution method. Results showed significant antibacterial activity against tested bacteria and yeast. The essential oil inhibited the growth of all tested bacteria and the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined to be around 10–40 μg mL−1, even in the case of yeast it was 5 mg mL−1. Distilled aromatic water contains much less substances but tests showed that it still has antimicrobial activity against all tested microbes (more on Gram-negative bacteria and yeast).

Role of Fine Structural Dynamics in Recognition of Histone H3 by HP1 gamma(CSD) Dimer and Ability of Force Fields to Describe Their Interaction Network,"Human heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a key factor in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Its chromo-shadow domain (CSD) homodimerizes, and the HP1 dimer acts as a hub, transiently interacting with diverse binding partner (BP) proteins. We analyze atomistic details of interactions of the HPl gamma(CSD) dimer with one of its targets, the histone H3 N-terminal tail, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The goal is to complement the available X-ray crystallography data and unravel potential dynamic effects in the molecular recognition. Our results suggest that HP1(CSD)-BP recognition involves structural dynamics of both partners, including structural communication between adjacent binding pockets that may fine-tune the sequence recognition. For example, HP1 Trp174 sidechain substates may help in distinguishing residues bound in the conserved HP1(CSD) +/- 2 hydrophobic pockets. Further, there is intricate competition between the binding of negatively charged HP1 C-terminal extension and solvent anions near the +/- 2 hydrophobic pockets, which is also influenced by the BP sequence. Phosphorylated H3 Y41 can interact with the same site. We also analyze the ability of several pair-additive force fields to describe the protein-protein interface. ff14SB and ff99SB-ILDN* provide the closest correspondence with the crystallographic model. The ffl5ipq local dynamics are somewhat less consistent with details of the experimental structure, while larger perturbations of the interface commonly occur in CHARMM36m simulations. The balance of some interactions, mainly around the anion binding site, also depends on the ion parameters. Some differences between the simulated and experimental structures are attributable to crystal packing.",10301.0,"Pokorná, Pavlína:Krepl, Miroslav:Bártová, Eva:Šponer, Jiří",Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,3,medium,medium,0,0,high,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Transformation of arsenic-rich copper smelter flue dust in contrasting soils: A 2-year field experiment,"Dust emissions from copper smelters processing arsenic-bearing ores represent a risk to soil environments due to the high levels of As and other inorganic contaminants. Using an in situ experiment in four different forest and grassland soils (pH 3.2-8.0) we studied the transformation of As-rich (&gt,50 wt% As) copper smelter dust over 24 months. Double polyamide bags with 1 g of flue dust were buried at different depths in soil pits and in 6-month intervals, then those bags, surrounding soil columns, and soil pore waters were collected and analysed. Dust dissolution was relatively fast during the first 6 months (5-34%), and mass losses attained 52% after 24 months. The key driving forces affecting dust dissolution were not only pH, but also the water percolation retention in individual soils. Primary arsenolite (As2O3) dissolution was responsible for high As release from the dust (to 72%) and substantial increase of As in the soil (to a 56 x increase, to 1500 mg kg(-1)). Despite high arsenolite solubility, this phase persisted in the dust after 2 years of exposure. Mineralogical investigation indicated that mimetite [Pb-5(AsO4)(3)(Cl,OH)], unidentified complex Ca-Pb-Fe-Zn arsenates, and Fe oxyhydroxides partly controlled the mobility of As and other metal(loid)s. Compared to As, other less abundant contaminants (Bi, Cu, Pb, Sb, Zn) were released into the soil to a lesser extent (8-40% of total). The relatively high mobility of As in the soil can be seen from decreases of bulk As concentrations after spring snowmelt, high water-extractable fractions with up to similar to 50% of As(III) in extracts, and high As concentrations in soil pore waters. Results indicate that efficient controls of emissions from copper smelters and flue dust disposal sites are needed to prevent extensive contamination of nearby soils by persistent As.",10505.0,"Jarošíková, Alice:Ettler, Vojtěch:Mihaljevič, Martin:Penizek, Vit:Matousek, Tomas:Culka, Adam:Drahota, Petr",Environmental Pollution,3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Most renal epithelial tumors can be diagnosed easily based on pure histologic findings with or without immunohistochemical examination. Furthermore, molecular-genetic testing can be utilized to assist in arriving at an accurate diagnosis. In this review, we presented the most current knowledge concerning molecular-genetic aspects of renal epithelial neoplasms, which potentially can be used in daily diagnostic practice.

Using the DataFromSky System to Monitor Emissions from Traffic,"The issue of transport emissions and their impact on human health is becoming increasingly topical. One of the possible approaches to solving this issue is using data obtained from the DataFromSky software for modelling of intensities and emission from traffic. This is the software tool that uses real traffic information about the monitored traffic area, such as the type of the passing vehicles, their speed and acceleration profile. These data are obtained on the basis of monitoring the traffic area with the application of the drone technology or camera system. The software is then able to analyse the monitored area and the traffic intensity. Besides, the data obtained may then be used for modelling the emission with a suitable software tool.

Crossing the left-right party divide? Understanding the electoral success of the Czech Pirate Party in the 2017 parliamentary elections,"In the 2017 Czech parliamentary election, the Czech Pirate Party (Pirates) gained 10.79% of the votes - an unprecedented success, compared to most of the pirate parties across Europe. However, as their electoral gain varies widely across the Czech Republic&apos,s territory, this article analyses all (more than 6000) Czech municipalities in the elections of 2010, 2013, and 2017 to explain this variation. Overall, the success of the Pirates was driven especially by obtaining much more support in larger municipalities with younger populations (although not only those aged 18-24 but also older ones), lower unemployment, higher turnout, and lower support for leftist parties. Thus, from a spatial perspective, the patterns of Pirate voting largely resembled long-term spatial support for Czech rightist parties and we can conclude that the Pirates made considerable inroads to regions which had historically been strongholds of the Civic Democratic Party, as the former main party of the right, but also strongholds of minor right-wing (&apos,liberal centre&apos,) parties of the 1990s and early 2000s. Success of the Pirates thus was based especially on votes from municipalities located in more developed areas, where the Pirates received many more votes than in structurally disadvantaged regions.",50601.0,"Maškarinec, Pavel",Politics,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Targeted proteomics driven verification of biomarker candidates associated with breast cancer aggressiveness,"Breast cancer is the most common and molecularly relatively well characterized malignant disease in women, however, its progression to metastatic cancer remains lethal for 78% of patients 5years after diagnosis. Novel markers could identify the high risk patients and their verification using quantitative methods is essential to overcome genetic, inter-tumor and intra-tumor variability and translate novel findings into cancer diagnosis and treatment. We recently identified 13 proteins associated with estrogen receptor, tumor grade and lymph node status, the key factors of breast cancer aggressiveness, using untargeted proteomics. Here we verified these findings in the same set of 96 tumors using targeted proteomics based on selected reaction monitoring with mTRAQ labeling (mTRAQ-SRM), transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry and validated in 5 independent sets of 715 patients using transcriptomics. We confirmed: (i) positive association of anterior gradient protein 2 homolog (AGR2) and periostin (POSTN) and negative association of annexin A1 (ANXA1) with estrogen receptor status, (ii) positive association of stathmin (STMN1), cofilin-1 (COF1), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 RNA-binding protein (PAIRBP1) and negative associations of thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) and POSTN levels with tumor grade, and (iii) positive association of POSTN, alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4) and STMN1 with lymph node status.

Between Imagination and Gambling: The Forms of Validity in Scholastic Logic,"Scholastic logic provided us with a variety of accounts of validity. With some degree of simplification, validity translated into truth-preservation evaluated against a set of worlds (casus) and was tested against a set of counter-models (instantia). Which inferences are valid depends on replacing ‘a set’ by ‘the set’ in such definitions, in other words by specifying the underlying concept of modality. Four levels of modality can be identified in scholastic logic: what can be imagined (casus imaginabilis), what can be the case (casus possibilis), what is the case in situations similar to the actual world (ut nunc), and what is mostly the case (ut in pluribus). The result of these analyses are general accounts of both deductive and inductive validity. The paper aims at various uses of ‘casus’ (or equivalent concepts) pertaining to the analysis of validity between the fourteenth-century Calculatores and the eighteenth-century post-Bernoullian or post-Wolffian use of ‘casus’ (in the sense of an outcome in the mathematical treatment of probability and probabilistic logic).

Free motion around black holes with discs or rings: between integrability and chaos-V,"The complete integrability of geodesic motion, the well-known feature of fields of isolated stationary black holes, can easily be &quot,spoiled&quot, by the presence of some additional sources (even if highly symmetric). In previous papers, we used various methods to show how free time-like motion becomes chaotic if the gravitational field of the Schwarzschild black hole is perturbed by that of a circular disk or ring, considering specifically the inverted first disk of the Morgan-Morgan counter-rotating family and the Bach-Weyl ring as additional sources. The present paper focuses on two new points. First, because the Bach-Weyl thin ring is physically quite unsatisfactory, we now repeat some of the analyses for a different, Majumdar-Papapetrou-type (extremally charged) ring around an extreme Reissner-Nordström black hole, and compare the results with those obtained before. We also argue that such a system is in fact more relevant astrophysically than it may seem. Second, we check numerically, for the latter system as well as for the Schwarzschild black hole encircled by the inverted Morgan-Morgan disk, how indicative the geometric (curvature) criterion is for the chaos suggested by Sota et al.

Assessing architectural heritage: identifying and evaluating heritage values for masonry and cast-iron buildings and structures,"Determination of heritage value of a structure or of its part is a very important step before choosing a particular survey method and subsequent renovation technique. Setting the level of possible invasiveness of survey and renovation methods is highly important for both quantity and quality of information which can be obtained during diagnostics processes and very decisive for setting the most suitable reconstruction technique in structural heritage. This research applies a specific form of structural analysis to define and quantify heritage values of both heritage listed and non-listed load-bearing structures (with a special focus to masonry and cast-iron structures). The method is based on a partition of a complex term heritage value to its elementary parts such as historical value, age value, use value, creative value, craftsmanship value, etc., which are then evaluated and put back together to help to create more objective opinion on a heritage value of the whole structure or of its part.",20101.0,"Eberhardt, Sophie:Pospíšil, Martin",Structures and Architecture: Bridging the Gap and Crossing Borders,3,medium,high,1,1,medium,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Microstructural aspects of new grade ODS alloy consolidated by rotary swaging,"In the present paper, the authors have investigated the microstructural aspects of recrystallization of new ODSnalloy (Fe-14Cr-10Al-4Y2O3) consolidated by hot rotary swaging. Microstructural characterization of samples wasnperformed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electronnbackscattered diffraction (EBSD). Insight of mechanical properties was performed by Vickers hardness testingnand measurement of Young’s modulus. A thorough analysis of microstructure concerning grains, oxide particlesnand dislocations was performed for two states of the material, i.e. in the as-received state after rotary swagingnexhibiting the ultra-fine-grained microstructure and in the state after annealing provoking the desirable coarse-grainednstructure. Different conditions of rotary swaging followed by the same annealing conditions inducedndifferent structures, either coarse-grained or bimodal when secondary recrystallization did not happen in thenentire sample’s volume. The hardness measurements revealed no significant difference between the coarse-grainednand the bimodal microstructures, however, the coarse-grained material exhibited systematicallynhigher values of the temperature-dependent Young’s modulus in comparison with the bimodal counterpart.nDetailed microscopic analysis of the material helped to clarify and discuss the measured properties of the newlyndeveloped ODS alloy.",20501.0,"Chlupová, Alice:Šulák, Ivo:Kunčická, Lenka:Kocich, R.:Svoboda, Jiří",Materials Characterization,3,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Geospatial Intelligence in Dealing with COVID-19 Challenges in Czechia,"The presented research deals with aspects of geospatial support to the COVID-19 in the Czechia. The first three cases of the disease were confirmed on March 1, 2020. Geospatial intelligence has played an important role in analysing and predicting the spread of the disease, in designing and optimizing measures against it, and in reducing harm. Three categories of applications were identified and described when following the conducted analysis of the content and purpose of COVID-19-related geospatial applications and solutions. The first, the visual analytics of COVID-19-related health statistics follows the concept of multiple coordinated views and dynamic queries. This category of applications uses various official or semi-official sources of geospatial data and their presentation in interactive web maps. The second, different tracking applications or tools for analysis of people’s movement and identification of risky contacts was implemented. In the Czechia, these are for example eRouska mobile application and movement tracking in the Mapy.cz application. The third category represents decision support systems for public administration, emergency services and volunteers. Example of this category is the interactive map of registered volunteers used by coordination centre established by Masaryk University (MUNI) in Brno, Czechia. The advantages, limitations, and possible future directions of the mentioned applications of geospatial intelligence are discussed in the conclusions.",50700.0,"Konečný, Milan:Hladík, Jiří:Bouchal, Jiří:Herman, Lukáš:Řezník, Tomáš","COVID-19 Pandemic, Geospatial Information, and Community Resilience: Global Applications and Lessons",3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"How microbial community composition, sorption and simultaneous application of six pharmaceuticals affect their dissipation in soils","Pharmaceuticals may enter soils due to the application of treated wastewater or biosolids. Their leakage from soils towards the groundwater, and their uptake by plants is largely controlled by sorption and degradation of those compounds in soils. Standard laboratory batch degradation and sorption experiments were performed using soil samples obtained from the top horizons of seven different soil types and 6 pharmaceuticals. Soils groups according to basic soils properties and  sorption of compounds matched. Soils groups according to microbial community structure and half-lives corresponded. Half-lives could be predicted using one microbial criterion and sorption coefficient. Simultaneous application of all compound smostly reduced their dissipation in soils.

Cell and Developmental Biology of Plant Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,"Plant mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) constitute a network of signaling cascades responsible for transducing extracellular stimuli and decoding them to dedicated cellular and developmental responses that shape the plant body. Over the last decade, we have accumulated information about how MAPK modules control the development of reproductive tissues and gametes and the embryogenic and postembryonic development of vegetative organs such as roots, root nodules, shoots, and leaves. Of key importance to understanding how MAPKs participate in developmental and environmental signaling is the characterization of their subcellular localization, their interactions with upstream signal perception mechanisms, and the means by which they target their substrates. In this review, we summarize the roles of MAPK signaling in the regulation of key plant developmental processes, and we survey what is known about the mechanisms guiding the subcellular compartmentalization of MAPK modules.",10605.0,"Komis, Georgios:Šamajová, Olga:Ovečka, Miroslav:Šamaj, Jozef",Annual Review of Plant Biology,3,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Dynamics of Violence in Micah,"The vocabulary of violence in the Book of Micah is virtually ubiquitous. This makes violence one of the dominant themes of this book and raises a question of its role within it. The present study analyses the vocabulary of violence and finds three ways in which it is referred to. The first group of texts describes the violence of the Israelites against their neighbours, consisting mainly in social injustice. As a consequence of this internal violence, the second group talks of the violence of foreign nations against Israel. Finally – as revenge for the previous, second type of violence – the third group of texts presents the violence of Israel against the foreign nations. Thus, the Book of Micah describes a chain of violence, where one case of violence inexorably produces another. This might be a gloomy, albeit realistic and sober scenario of the human condition. However, the Book of Micah offers also a way out of this sad situation. It is hinted at in two passages, where Micah talks about divine violence against the violence itself, thereby being a kind of a fourth type of violence. In this way, Micah’s thought resembles Pauline theology of human sin and divine grace.",60303.0,"Mackerle, Adam","BER, Viktor (ed.)

Recognition of a Trust as a Specific Problem in Private International Law,"Recognition of a trust as a legal institution established under foreign legal order is quite remarkable per se because the objective law governs the recognition with exception of the application of the law governing the personal issues. The aim of the recognition of a trust is to allow it to develop its functions under its governing law in the legal context of a country of recognition. This requires to recognize it in terms of transposition of all possible effects enumerated for instance in Article 11 (2) and 3 of The Hague Convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition into the other legal system. This aim should be achieved by transformation into similar legal institution of the country of recognition. A single law applicable to the trust should notably govern the trustees' duties, rights of beneficiaries, trustees' liability and legal relationships between the trustee and trust creditors.

PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WITH PARALYMPIC ATHLETES,"This chapter aims to summarize the literature on mental skills and athletes with disabilities and offers specific suggestions for applied practitioners working in the field. The rationale for Psychological skills training (PST) is based on an assumption that an athlete&apos,s negative thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations can hinder peak performance and that mental strategies can be used to enhance optimal performance. Mindfulness-based interventions have been conducted with various populations, ranging from people with chronic pain to cancer to those with cardiovascular disease. Applied work within disability sport has focused primarily on practical considerations when delivering PST programs to athletes with disabilities. Athletes and coaches of high-performance disability sports value the use of mental skills.

Surface Tension of Supercooled Water: Inflection Point-Free Course down to 250 K Confirmed Using a Horizontal Capillary Tube,"The temperature course of the surface tension of supercooled water was suspected to exhibit an anomalous feature – the so called second inflection point (SIP). Besides some theoretical and molecular simulation studies, this hypothesis was primarily supported by experimental data by P.T. Hacker (1951). Recently, the present group performed accurate surface tension measurements down to –26 °C using a modified capillary rise technique which, in contrast to Hacker’s data, showed no SIP anomaly. In order to confirm that the qualitatively different observations are not related to some fundamental phenomenon, we developed an experimental device employing basically the same method as Hacker with a horizontal capillary tube. New experimental data for the surface tension of supercooled water measured with the horizontal capillary setup down to –23 °C are presented in this study. The new data show a very good agreement with the previous capillary rise measurements. It was confirmed that the temperature dependence of the surface tension is free of SIP in a temperature range from        –23 °C to 23 °C and can be well represented by the IAPWS standard extrapolated below 0.01 °C. However, a small systematic deviation from the IAPWS correlation can be seen at temperatures below –15 °C.",20303.0,"Vinš, Václav:Hošek, Jan:Hykl, Jiří:Hrubý, Jan",Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data,3,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Maximum peak muscle torque of the knee extensors and flexors in the PL and NPL as well as ipsilateral knee flexors and knee extensors ratio (H:Q ratio) for both legs were assessed. BV was significantly decreased in POST physical load (5.82%, BV (PRE) =30.79 +/- 1.70m&lt,bold&gt,s &lt,/bold&gt, (-1) , BV (POST) =29.00 +/- 1.70m&lt,bold&gt,s &lt,/bold&gt, (-1) , t (19) =3.67, p=0.00, d=1.05).

Real consequences matter: Why hypothetical biases in the valuation of time persist even in controlled lab experiments,"In a controlled lab experiment, we investigate hypothetical biases in the value of time by comparing stated preference (SP) and revealed preference (RP) values attached to unexpected waiting times. The SP and RP choice sets are identical in terms of design with the only difference being that the RP choices have real consequences in terms of unexpected waiting times and monetary incentives. We find a substantial hypothetical bias with the average SP value of time being only 70% of the corresponding RP value. The bias is mainly driven by participants who have scheduling constraints during the time of the unexpected wait. Scheduling constraints are taken into account to a much lesser extent in the SP setting than in the RP setting, presumably because only in the latter, the consequences of ignoring them are costly.

Population history explains the performance of an annual herb - Within and beyond its European species range,"The centre periphery hypothesis (CPH) predicts a decrease in population performance from the centre of the species range towards the edge, hindering further species expansion. To overcome ecological limitation, local adaptation of peripheral populations is assumed necessary to extend niche space and thus to potentially facilitate species range expansion. However, adaptive changes do not necessarily correspond to current ecological marginality. Instead, population history may provide a fuller context for understanding patterns of local adaptation within the species range. Here, we test whether local adaptation to current conditions or population history explains current species distribution in an annual heterocarpic species, Atriplex tatarica, in Europe.

Ion-exchange HPLC-ICP-MS: A new window to chromium speciation in biological tissues,"The presented work proposes a novel analytical ICP-MS-based approach for the accurate and precise chromium speciation in biological tissues. The determination of total Cr(VI) and soluble Cr(III) species was carried out by alkaline EDTA extraction followed by their separation using ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IE-HPLC-ICP-MS). The developed method was validated according to the procedure given in the United States Food and Drug Administration guideline on the validation of bioanalytical methods. Validation parameters included limit of detection (&lt,= 0.03 mu g g(-1)), limit of quantification (&lt,= 0.08 mu g g(-1)), linearity (&gt,= 0.9998), intra-day and inter-day accuracy (86-110%) and precision ( 10%), extraction recovery (89-110%), carry-over effect and sensitivity. In addition, special attention was paid to the study of chromium species interconversion and the elimination of spectral interferences. Moreover, the validated ICP-MS method employing microwave acid digestion was used to determine the total Cr content in collected fractions. Finally, the whole ICP-MS-based methodology was applied to the analyses of two certified reference materials of hepatopancreas tissue. Obtained results indicated that the majority of chromium in biological tissues is bound to the solid residue, Cr(VI) was determined in none of the samples investigated.

Substitution of nickel in Mg2Ni and its hydride with elements from groups XIII and XIV: An ab initio study,"We have performed ab initio calculations with equilibrium supercells of the Mg2Ni compound and its hydride Mg2NiH4 doped with elements X = Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge and Sn. Two concentrations of X in both structures have been set: (1) every 16th, and (2) every fourth Ni atom has been substituted by X. Total energy calculations yielded the Mg2NiH4 hydrogen absorption enthalpy ΔHabs according to the chemical reaction Mg2Ni + 2H2 → Mg2NiH4. Reduction of the hydrogen absorption enthalpy was reported for both concentrations of X. When doping the Mg2NiH4 hydride with X = In in a low concentration (1), the value of hydrogen desorption enthalpy decreases from 68.22 to 55.96 kJ(mol H2)−1. Doping with X = In in a high concentration (2) further decreases the hydrogen desorption enthalpy to 5.50 kJ(mol H2)−1. Further, the electronic structure of Mg2(Ni–In)H4 hydride with a low In concentration indicates weaker Ni–H bonds in comparison with the pristine Mg2NiH4.

Since the related bounding (Liapunov-like) functions are strictly localized on the boundaries of parameter sets of candidate solutions, some trajectories are allowed to escape from these sets.",10103.0,"Pavlačková, Martina:Taddei, Valentina",Electronic Journal of Qualitative Theory of Differential Equations,3,medium,high,1,0,medium,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Complex investigation of deformation twinning in gamma-TiAl by TEM and neutron diffraction,A near-gamma TiAl based alloy with 2 at% of Nb was investigated by means of collaborative research based on transmission electron microscopy and in-situ neutron diffraction techniques with the aim to study mechanical twinning and its role within the mechanisms governing fatigue response and material properties. In-situ neutron diffraction measurements were performed during low cycle fatigue straining at room temperature. Induced lattice strain related to the formation of deformation twins was detected and used to follow changes in the macroscopic material response caused by the twinning process during cycling. A microscopic insight was realised by using several transmission electron microscopy techniques to reveal in detail an internal deformation microstructure of the material at the beginning as well as at the end of the fatigue life. The study was focused on the first loading cycles where the material shows intense cyclic hardening. The effect of mechanical twinning on the material behaviour at several stages of the fatigue life is discussed for two different total strain amplitudes of 0.2% and 0.4%.,0.0,"Beran, Přemysl:Heczko, Milan:Kruml, Tomáš:Panzner, T.:van Petegem, S.",Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Progress in forensic bone DNA analysis: Lessons learned from ancient DNA,"Research on ancient and forensic DNA is related in many ways, and the two fields must deal with similar ob-stacles. Therefore, communication between these two communities has the potential to improve results in both research fields. Here, we present the insights gained in the ancient DNA community with regard to analyzing DNA from aged skeletal material and the potential use of the developed protocols in forensic work. We discuss the various steps, from choosing samples for DNA extraction to deciding between classical PCR amplification and massively parallel sequencing approaches. Based on the progress made in ancient DNA analyses combined with the requirements of forensic work, we suggest that there is substantial potential for incorporating ancient DNA approaches into forensic protocols, a process that has already begun to a considerable extent. However, taking full advantage of the experiences gained from ancient DNA work will require comparative studies by the forensic DNA community to tailor the methods developed for ancient samples to the specific needs of forensic studies and case work.

"Characterization of esophageal motor activity, gastroesophageal reflux, and evaluation of prokinetic effectiveness in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients: a high-resolution impedance manometry study","Background Motility disorders of upper gastrointestinal tract are common in critical illness and associated with significant clinical consequences. However, detailed quantitative and qualitative analyses of esophageal motor functions are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the key features of esophageal motility functions using high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) and to evaluate an objective link between esophageal motor patterns, gastric emptying, and gastroesophageal reflux. We also studied the prokinetic effects of metoclopramide. Methods We prospectively performed HRIM for 16 critically ill hemodynamically stable patients. Patients were included if they had low gastric volume (LGV, &lt, 100 mL/24 h, n = 8) or high gastric volume (HGV, &gt, 500 mL/24 h, n = 8). The HRIM data were collected for 5 h with intravenous metoclopramide administration (10 mg) after the first 2 h. Results The findings were grossly abnormal for all critically ill patients. The esophageal contraction vigor was markedly increased, indicating prevailing hypercontractile esophagus. Ineffective propulsive force was observed for 73% of esophageal activities. Panesophageal pressurization was the most common pressurization pattern (64%). Gastroesophageal reflux predominantly occurred with transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. The common features of the LGV group were a hyperreactive pattern, esophagogastric outflow obstruction, and frequent reflux. Ineffective motility with reduced lower esophageal sphincter tone, and paradoxically fewer reflux episodes, was common in the HGV group. Metoclopramide administration reduced the number of esophageal activities but did not affect the number of reflux episodes in either group. Conclusion All critically ill patients had major esophageal motility abnormalities, and motility patterns varied according to gastric emptying status. Well-preserved gastric emptying and maintained esophagogastric barrier functions did not eliminate reflux. Metoclopramide failed to reduce the number of reflux episodes regardless of gastric emptying status. Trial registration ISRCTN, ISRCTN14399966.

Carbon dots based FRET for the detection of DNA damage,"Here, we aimed our attention at the synthesis of carbon dots (C-dots) with the ability to interact with DNA to suggest an approach for the detection of DNA damage. Primarily, C-dots modified with amine moieties were synthesized using the one-step microwave pyrolysis of citric acid in the presence of diethylenetriamine. The C-dots showed strong photoluminescence with a quantum yield of 4%. In addition, the C-dots (2.8+-0.8 nm) possessed a good colloidal stability and exhibited a positive surface charge (ζ=36 mV) at a neutral pH. An interaction study of the C-dots and the DNA fragment of λ bacteriophage was performed, and the DNA binding resulted in changes to the photoluminescent and absorption properties of the C-dots. A binding of the C-dots to DNA was also observed as a change to DNA electrophoretic mobility and a decreased ability to intercalate ethidium bromide (EtBr). Moreover, the Förster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the C-dots and EtBr was studied, in which the C-dots serve as an excitation energy donor and the EtBr serves as an acceptor. When DNA was damaged using ultraviolet (UV) radiation (λ=254 nm) and hydroxyl radicals, the intensity of the emitted photoluminescence at 612 nm significantly decreased. The concept was proved on analysis of the genomic DNA from PC-3 cells and DNA isolated from melanoma tissues.",10406.0,"Kudr, Jiří:Richtera, Lukáš:Xhaxhiu, Kledi:Hynek, David:Heger, Zbyněk:Zítka, Ondřej:Adam, Vojtěch",Biosensors and Bioelectronics,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

External validation of International Prognostic Score for asymptomatic early stage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and proposal of an alternative score,"Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are nowadays diagnosed without any symptoms and do not require therapy. A prognostic score identifying patients within this large group who are at high risk of disease progression would be highly beneficial. The recently published International Prognostic Score for Early asymptomatic patients (IPS-E) uses combination of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &apos,15 x 109/l, palpable lymphadenopathy, and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IGHV) gene to predict the time to first-line therapy (TTFT). Patients at low, intermediate, and high risk had estimated 5-year TTFT of 8%, 28%, and 61%. We performed an external validation of the IPS-E score using an unselected, consecutive group of 130 Binet A patients. The 5-year TTFT was 11%, 36%, and 78% (C-statistic 0.74). Furthermore, we propose an alternative system (AIPS-E) using cytogenetic aberrations instead of palpable lymphadenopathy. This system yielded 5-year TTFT of 14%, 40%, and 72%. These results were externally validated in 388 Binet A patients from five Czech centres, the 5-year TTFT was 16%, 37%, and 80% (C-statistic 0.74).

Changes in oxygen saturation and the retinal nerve fibre layer in patients with optic neuritis associated with multiple sclerosis in a 6-month follow-up,"Purpose: Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the optic nerve, which can be the first manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS). The main goal was to assess changes in the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and in retinal oxygen saturation [arterial (AS), venous (VS) and arterio-venous (A-V) difference] in the affected and unaffected eye. Methods: Fifty patients with ON due to MS within 3 months of onset of symptoms were enrolled (17 males, mean age 35.3). All patients were examined at baseline (V1) and after 6 months (V2) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to get RNFL values, automatic retinal oximetry to obtain saturation values, and ultrasound to exclude arterial stenosis, and orbital colour Doppler imaging was performed in the ophthalmic artery. Results: At V1, AS was significantly increased in affected eye compared to unaffected eye (99.5% versus 98.0%, p = 0.03). Significant decrease in A-V difference from baseline was detected in both eyes for ON eye: 32.0% versus 29.0%, p = 0.004, for fellow eye: 31.4% versus 30.0%, p = 0.04. We did not observe any changes in retinal vessel diameter. There were no changes observed in blood flow in ophthalmic artery. At V1, there were no significant differences in RNFL, and significant loss of RNFL was confirmed in the affected eye at V2 (95 lm versus 86 lm, p = 0.0002) and in comparison with the fellow eye (86 lm versus 94 lm, p = 0.0002). There were no correlations between RNFL and saturation values at V1, although at V2, there was a negative correlation between the RNFL and AS (Spearman’s rho = - 0.480, p = 0.003) and between the RNFL and VS (rho = - 0.620, p = 0.00007). Conclusion: Retinal oximetry is altered in both eyes in MS patients with unilateral ON. During the course of the disease, the retinal oxygen consumption decreases to a different degree in each eye and this change is not completely followed by changes in the RNFL thickness, suggesting either sub-clinical ON or systemic effects in the clinically unaffected eye. Since this is the first and initial longitudinal evaluation of the saturation changes inMS patients, the clinical value of these findings needs to be deeper evaluated in the future studies.",30210.0,"Šínová, Irena:Dorňák, Tomáš:Hübnerová, Petra:Kaňovský, Petr:Šín, Martin",Acta Ophthalmologica,3,low,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Review of the state of the art and future prospects of the ground-based GNSS meteorology in Europe,"Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) have revolutionised positioning, navigation, and timing, becoming a common part of our everyday life. Aside from these well-known civilian and commercial applications, GNSS is now an established atmospheric observing system, which can accurately sense water vapour, the most abundant greenhouse gas, accounting for 60–70 % of atmospheric warming. In Europe, the application of GNSS in meteorology started roughly two decades ago, and today it is a well-established field in both research and operation. This review covers the state of the art in GNSS meteorology in Europe. The advances in GNSS processing for derivation of tropospheric products, application of GNSS tropospheric products in operational weather prediction and application of GNSS tropospheric products for climate monitoring are discussed. The GNSS processing techniques and tropospheric products are reviewed. A summary of the use of the products for validation and impact studies with operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models as well as very short weather prediction (nowcasting) case studies is given. Climate research with GNSSs is an emerging field of research, but the studies so far have been limited to comparison with climate models and derivation of trends.   More than 15 years of GNSS meteorology in Europe has already achieved outstanding cooperation between the atmospheric and geodetic communities. It is now feasible to develop next-generation GNSS tropospheric products and applications that can enhance the quality of weather forecasts and climate monitoring.

Phosphorylation of PLK3 Is Controlled by Protein Phosphatase 6,"Polo-like kinases play essential roles in cell cycle control and mitosis. In contrast to other members of this kinase family, PLK3 has been reported to be activated upon cellular stress including DNA damage, hypoxia and osmotic stress. Here we knocked outPLK3in human non-transformed RPE cells using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Surprisingly, we find that loss of PLK3 does not impair stabilization of HIF1 alpha after hypoxia, phosphorylation of the c-Jun after osmotic stress and dynamics of DNA damage response after exposure to ionizing radiation. Similarly, RNAi-mediated depletion of PLK3 did not impair stress response in human transformed cell lines. Exposure of cells to various forms of stress also did not affect kinase activity of purified EGFP-PLK3. We conclude that PLK3 is largely dispensable for stress response in human cells. Using mass spectrometry, we identify protein phosphatase 6 as a new interacting partner of PLK3. Polo box domain of PLK3 mediates the interaction with the PP6 complex. Finally, we find that PLK3 is phosphorylated at Thr219 in the T-loop and that PP6 constantly dephosphorylates this residue. However, in contrast to PLK1, phosphorylation of Thr219 does not upregulate enzymatic activity of PLK3, suggesting that activation of both kinases is regulated by distinct mechanisms.",10608.0,"Perez, Cecilia Aquino:Palek, Matouš:Stolařová, Lenka:von Morgen, Patrick:Macůrek, Libor",Cells,3,low,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Using drone-mounted cameras for on-site body documentation: 3D mapping and active survey,"Recent advances in unmanned aerial technology have substantially lowered the cost associated with aerial imagery. As a result, forensic practitioners are today presented with easy low-cost access to aerial photographs at remote locations. The present paper aims to explore boundaries in which the low-end drone technology can operate as professional crime scene equipment, and to test the prospects of aerial 3D modeling in the forensic context. The study was based on recent forensic cases of falls from height admitted for postmortem examinations. Three mock outdoor forensic scenes featuring a dummy, skeletal remains and artificial blood were constructed at an abandoned quarry and subsequently documented using a commercial DJI Phantom 2 drone equipped with a GoPro HERO 4 digital camera. In two of the experiments, the purpose was to conduct aerial and ground-view photography and to process the acquired images with a photogrammetry protocol (using Agisoft PhotoScan® 1.2.6) in order to generate 3D textured models. The third experiment tested the employment of drone-based video recordings in mapping scattered body parts. The results show that drone-based aerial photography is capable of producing high-quality images, which are appropriate for building accurate large-scale 3D models of a forensic scene. If, however, high-resolution top-down three-dimensional scene documentation featuring details on a corpse or other physical evidence is required, we recommend building a multi-resolution model by processing aerial and ground-view imagery separately. The video survey showed that using an overview recording for seeking out scattered body parts was efficient. In contrast, the less easy-to-spot evidence, such as bloodstains, was detected only after having been marked properly with crime scene equipment.",30501.0,"Urbanová, Petra:Jurda, Mikoláš:Vojtíšek, Tomáš:Krajsa, Jan",Forensic Science International,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Preferred reading of Legal Texts,"In the 1970s, British cultural theorist Stuart Hall introduced a concept known as preferred reading. It combines the ideological influence of mass media and dominant ways of understanding any text. This article focuses on mass media as a source of ideological background or context of legal interpretation and of any reading of legal texts. Law operates in culture and culture represents limitations in the law, according to the needs of dominant ideology. Culture introduces structures of domination which manipulate law. An important role is also given to popular culture and mass culture. These parts of the culture industry create borders in which the recipients (audience) think of law.

Nutritional and socio-economic predictors of adult height in 152 world populations,"Height is one of the most sensitive indicators of well-being because it combines the external influences of nutrition, economic wealth, health care, social equality, and other important socio-economic factors. The aim of this ecological study was to compare actual values of male and female height from 152 populations (except sub-Saharan Africa) with the mean supply of 47 food items from the FAOSTAT database (1995-2013) and mean values of seven socio-economic indicators (1995-2013). This comparison shows that economic wealth at the country level is only a mediocre correlate of physical growth because it is only loosely associated with the quality of nutrition and it does not reflect the social distribution of wealth. In a multiple regression model, the best predictors of stature are protein sources of the best and worst quality, and total fertility (which critically influences the amount of resources expended per child). In summary, these findings indicate that irrespective of crude economic statistics, the choice of specific nutrient sources and small family size are crucial factors determining the optimal physical development of children.

Hybrid sterility genes in mice (Mus musculus): a peculiar case of PRDM9 incompatibility,"Hybrid sterility is a critical step in the evolution of reproductive barriers between diverging taxa during the process of speciation. Recent studies of young subspecies of the house mouse revealed a multigenic nature and frequent polymorphism of hybrid sterility genes as well as the recurrent engagement of the meiosis-specific gene PR domain-containing 9 (Prdm9) and X-linked loci. Prdm9-controlled hybrid sterility is essentially chromosomal in nature, conditioned by the sequence divergence between subspecies. Depending on the Prdm9 interallelic interactions and the X-linked Hstx2 locus, the same homologs either regularly recombine and synapse, or show impaired DNA DSB repair, asynapsis, and early meiotic arrest. Thus, Prdm9-dependent hybrid sterility points to incompatibilities affecting meiotic recombination as a possible mechanism of reproductive isolation between (sub)species.",10603.0,"Forejt, Jiří:Jansa, Petr:Parvanov, Emil",Trends in Genetics,3,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ecotoxicity assessment of short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins used in polyvinyl-chloride products for construction industry,"Short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) have been commonly used as plasticizers and flame retardants in polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) products for the construction industry. During the last few years the production of SCCPs has been banned or reduced in Europe, Japan, USA, and Canada due to their toxic and bioaccumulative effects but they have been still produced and used under less controlled conditions worldwide. Middle chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) were suggested as a suitable alternative to SCCPs for PVC production instead. In this paper, the ecotoxicity of SCCPs and MCCPs is studied using the methods of potentially affected fraction of species (PAF) and the most sensitive species (MSS). Characterization factors (CFs) are estimated for SCCPs by the PAF method (for MCCPs suitable ecotoxicological indexes are not available) and for MCCPs by the MSS method (for SCCPs PEC values are negligible). Results of the present study indicate that from an ecotoxicological point of view, MCCPs may present similar ecological risks as SCCPs. Therefore, it is recommended both SCCPs and MCCPs not to be used worldwide in PVC products for the construction industry. The most suitable alternative for SCCPs seems to be inorganic compounds but their environmental impacts have not been sufficiently excluded yet",20101.0,"Kobetičová, Klára:Černý, Robert",The Science of the Total Environment,3,low,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Frequency-dependent fatigue damage in polycrystalline copper analyzed by FIB tomography,"Pure polycrystalline copper has been subjected to cyclic loading with frequencies from 4 Hz to 20 kHz. With increasing frequency, the S-N curve was shifted to a higher number of cycles to fracture. Quasi-static and dynamic tensile tests were performed to identify the strain rate sensitivity corresponding to the increase of the cyclic frequency in order to explain the shift of the S-N curve with the frequency.nnSurface relief evolution has been studied in specimens cycled with various stress amplitudes and frequencies. Scanning electron microscopy inspection of the surface and the perpendicular cuts produced by focused ion beam sectioning allowed characterizing the surface relief and internal structure of the individual specimens subjected to cycling. Characteristic types of slip bands were found. In all cases, cavities formed in or around the primary slip plane below the slip markings. Focused ion beam slicing and image recording with subsequent 3D reconstruction allowed obtaining the distribution of cavities below the slip markings. A close relation was established between the distribution of cavities and resulting surface relief. Formation of cavities in the slip band led to the development of extrusions and in some cases also to tiny intrusions. Both rough surface relief and the cavity distribution below the surface along the slip plane contributed to the initiation of the fatigue cracks.

Postpartum profiling of microRNAs involved in pathogenesis of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases in women exposed to pregnancy-related complications,"Gestational hypertension (GH), preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) may predispose to later onset of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases. We examined if pregnancy complications induce postpartum alterations in gene expression of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease associated microRNAs. 29 microRNAs were tested in peripheral blood of women, compared between groups with a history of GH, PE, FGR and controls, and correlated with the severity of the disease regarding clinical signs, delivery date, and Doppler parameters. RESULTS: GH was associated with the up-regulation of miR-20a-5p, miR-143-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-221-3p, and miR-499a-5p. The up-regulation of miR-17-5p, miR-20b-5p, miR-29a-3p, and miR-126-3p was a mutual phenomenon of GH and severe PE. GH and early PE were associated with up-regulation of miR-1-3p and miR-17-5p. GH and late PE showed up-regulation of miR-17-5p, miR-20b-5p, and miR-29a-3p. Severe PE induced up-regulation of miR-133a-3p and down-regulation of miR-130b-3p. MiR-133a-3p up-regulation was also observed in early PE. PE and/or FGR with abnormal Doppler parameters demonstrated up-regulation of miR-100-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-133a-3p, and miR-145-5p. The combination screening was superior over using individual microRNAs for patients with GH, PE regardless of the severity of the disease, severe PE and early PE. A cardiovascular risk at patients with late PE, PE and/or FGR with abnormal Doppler parameters was identified more accurately using the single microRNA only. CONCLUSION: Epigenetic changes characteristic for cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases are present in women with a prior exposure to pregnancy complications. Screening of microRNAs may be used to identify patients at a higher risk of later development of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases.",10608.0,"Hromadníková, Ilona:Kotlabová, Kateřina:Dvořáková, Lenka:Krofta, Ladislav",International Journal of Cardiology,3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Photoactive and hydrophobic nano-ZnO/poly(alkyl siloxane) coating for the protection of sandstone,"Poly(alkyl siloxane) containing photoactive nano-ZnO (0.5 wt%) has been studied as a protective coating of glauconitic sandstone. Effect on visual appearance, hydrophobicity, porosity, water absorption/evaporation, and self-cleaning ability of the sandstone was measured. The results were evaluated in comparison with uncoated and poly(alkyl siloxane)-coated sandstone. Static contact angle of water reached 89 degrees +/- 3 degrees and 128 degrees +/- 2 degrees for poly(alkyl siloxane) and nano-ZnO/poly(alkyl siloxane) coating, respectively. Poly(alkyl siloxane) and nano-ZnO/poly(alkyl siloxane) coatings led to increased reduction in water absorption (>50%) for similar to 18 h and similar to 8 h, respectively, compared to the uncoated sandstone. The shorter time is compensated by self-cleaning ability: photodegradation of methylene blue on the nano-ZnO/poly(alkyl siloxane) coating after 5 h of UV irradiation was observed.

Cellulose Mesh with Charged Nanocellulose Coatings as a Promising Carrier of Skin and Stem Cells for Regenerative Applications,"Engineering artificial skin constructs is an ongoing challenge. An ideal material for hosting skin cells is still to be discovered. A promising candidate is low-cost cellulose, which is commonly fabricated in the form of a mesh and is applied as a wound dressing. Unfortunately, the structure and the topography of current cellulose meshes are not optimal for cell growth. To enhance the surface structure and the physicochemical properties of a commercially available mesh, we coated the mesh with wood-derived cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs). Three different types of mesh coatings are proposed in this study as a skin cell carrier: positively charged cationic cellulose nanofibrils (cCNFs), negatively charged anionic cellulose nanofibrils (aCNFs), and a combination of these two materials (c+aCNFs). These cell carriers were seeded with normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) or with human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to investigate cell adhesion, spreading, morphology, and proliferation. The negatively charged aCNF coating significantly improved the proliferation of both cell types. The positively charged cCNF coating significantly enhanced the adhesion of ADSCs only. The number of NHDFs was similar on the cCNF coatings and on the noncoated pristine cellulose mesh. However, the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the cCNF coating promoted cell survival. The c+aCNF construct proved to combine benefits from both types of CNFs, which means that the c+aCNF cell carrier is a promising candidate for further application in skin tissue engineering.",30404.0,"Pajorová, Julia:Skogberg, A.:Hadraba, Daniel:Brož, Antonín:Trávníčková, Martina:Zikmundová, Markéta:Honkanen, M.:Hannula, M.:Lahtinen, P.:Tomková, M.:Bačáková, Lucie:Kallio, P.",Biomacromolecules,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Persistent multi-scale fluctuations shift European hydroclimate to its millennial boundaries,"In recent years, there has been growing concern about the effect of global warming on water resources, especially at regional and continental scales. The last IPCC report on extremes states that there is medium confidence about an increase on European drought frequency during twentieth century. Here we use the Old World Drought Atlas palaeoclimatic reconstruction to show that when Europes hydroclimate is examined under a millennial, multi-scale perspective, a significant decrease in dryness can be observed since 1920 over most of central and northern Europe. On the contrary, in the south, drying conditions have prevailed, creating an intense north-to-south dipole.

A meta-heuristic based goal-selection strategy for mobile robot search in an unknown environment,"The single-robot search problem in an unknown environment is defined as the problem of finding a stationary object in the environment whose map is not known a priori. Compared to exploration, the only difference lies in goal selection as the objectives of search and exploration are dissimilar, i.e. a trajectory that is optimal in exploration does not necessarily minimize the expected value of the time to find an object along it. For this reason, in this paper we extend the preliminary ideas presented in Kulich et al. [1] to a general framework that accounts for the particular characteristics of the search problem. Within this framework, an important decision involved in the determination of the trajectory can be formulated as an instance of the Graph Search Problem (GSP), a generalization of the well-known Traveling Deliveryman Problem (TDP) which has not received much attention in the literature. We developed a tailored Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) meta-heuristic for the GSP, which generates good quality solutions in very short computing times and is incorporated in the overall framework. The proposed approach produces very good results in a simulation environment, showing that it is feasible from a computational standpoint and the proposed strategy outperforms the standard approaches.",10201.0,"Kulich, Miroslav:Miranda-Bront, J.:Přeučil, Libor",Computers & Operations Research,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Quantum versus classical simultaneity in communication complexity,"This paper addresses two problems in the context of two-party communication complexity of functions. First, it concludes the line of research which can be viewed as demonstrating qualitative advantage of quantum communication in the three most common communication 'layouts': two-way interactive communication, one-way communication and simultaneous message passing (SMP). I demonstrate a functional problem (cEqT) over tilde, whose communication complexity is O ((log n)(2)) in the quantum version of the SMP and (Omega) over tilde(root n) in the classical (randomized) version of SMP. Second, this paper contributes to understanding the power of the weakest commonly studied regime of quantum communication-SMP with quantum messages and without shared randomness (the latter restriction can be viewed as a somewhat artificial way of making the quantum model 'as weak as possible'). Our function (cEqT) over tilde has an efficient solution in this regime as well, which means that even lacking shared randomness, quantum SMP can be exponentially stronger than its classical counterpart with shared randomness.",10201.0,"Gavinsky, Dmitry",IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,3,high,high,1,1,high,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Botulinum toxin injection changes resting state cerebellar connectivity in cervical dystonia,"In cervical dystonia, functional MRI (fMRI) evidence indicates changes in several resting state networks, which revert in part following the botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT) therapy. Recently, the involvement of the cerebellum in dystonia has gained attention. The aim of our study was to compare connectivity between cerebellar subdivisions and the rest of the brain before and after BoNT treatment. Seventeen patients with cervical dystonia indicated for treatment with BoNT were enrolled (14 female, aged 50.2 ± 8.5 years, range 38–63 years). Clinical and fMRI examinations were carried out before and 4 weeks after BoNT injection. Clinical severity was evaluated using TWSTRS. Functional MRI data were acquired on a 1.5 T scanner during 8 min rest. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was performed using data extracted from atlas-defined cerebellar areas in both datasets. Clinical scores demonstrated satisfactory BoNT effect. After treatment, connectivity decreased between the vermis lobule VIIIa and the left dorsal mesial frontal cortex. Positive correlations between the connectivity differences and the clinical improvement were detected for the right lobule VI, right crus II, vermis VIIIb and the right lobule IX.

ORMDL2 Deficiency Potentiates the ORMDL3-Dependent Changes in Mast Cell Signaling,"The systemic anaphylactic reaction is a life-threatening allergic response initiated by activated mast cells. Sphingolipids are an essential player in the development and attenuation of this response. De novo synthesis of sphingolipids in mammalian cells is inhibited by the family of three ORMDL proteins (ORMDL1, 2, and 3). However, the cell and tissue-specific functions of ORMDL proteins in mast cell signaling are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine cross-talk of ORMDL2 and ORMDL3 proteins in IgE-mediated responses. To this end, we prepared mice with whole-body knockout (KO) of Ormdl2 and/or Ormdl3 genes and studied their role in mast cell-dependent activation events in vitro and in vivo. We found that the absence of ORMDL3 in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) increased the levels of cellular sphingolipids. Such an increase was further raised by simultaneous ORMDL2 deficiency, which alone had no effect on sphingolipid levels. Cells with double ORMDL2 and ORMDL3 KO exhibited increased intracellular levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Furthermore, we found that concurrent ORMDL2 and ORMDL3 deficiency increased I kappa B-alpha phosphorylation, degranulation, and production of IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-alpha cytokines in antigen-activated mast cells. Interestingly, the chemotaxis towards antigen was increased in all mutant cell types analyzed. Experiments in vivo showed that passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), which is initiated by mast cell activation, was increased only in ORMDL2,3 double KO mice, supporting our in vitro observations with mast cells. On the other hand, ORMDL3 KO and ORMDL2,3 double KO mice showed faster recovery from passive systemic anaphylaxis, which could be mediated by increased levels of blood S1P presented in such mice. Our findings demonstrate that Ormdl2 deficiency potentiates the ORMDL3-dependent changes in mast cell signaling.",30102.0,"Bugajev, Viktor:Hálová, Ivana:Demková, Lívia:Černohouzová, Sára:Vávrová, Petra:Mrkáček, Michal:Utekal, Pavol:Dráberová, Lubica:Kuchař, L.:Schuster, Bjorn:Dráber, Petr",Frontiers in Immunology,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tree differences in primary and secondary growth drive convergent scaling in leaf area to sapwood area across Europe,"Trees scale leaf (A(L)) and xylem (A(X)) areas to couple leaf transpiration and carbon gain with xylem water transport. Some species are known to acclimate in A(L) : A(X) balance in response to climate conditions, but whether trees of different species acclimate in A(L) : A(X) in similar ways over their entire (continental) distributions is unknown. We analyzed the species and climate effects on the scaling of A(L) vs A(X) in branches of conifers (Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies) and broadleaved (Betula pendula, Populus tremula) sampled across a continental wide transect in Europe. Along the branch axis, A(L) and A(X) change in equal proportion (isometric scaling: b similar to 1) as for trees. Branches of similar length converged in the scaling of A(L) vs A(X) with an exponent of b = 0.58 across European climates irrespective of species. Branches of slow- growing trees from Northern and Southern regions preferentially allocated into new leaf rather than xylem area, with older xylem rings contributing to maintaining total xylem conductivity. In conclusion, trees in contrasting climates adjust their functional balance between water transport and leaf transpiration by maintaining biomass allocation to leaves, and adjusting their growth rate and xylem production to maintain xylem conductance.",40102.0,"Petit, Giai:von Arx, Georg:Kiorapostolou, Natasa:Lechthaler, Silvia:Prendin, Angela Luisa:Anfodillo, Tommaso:Caldeira, Maria C.:Cochard, Hervé:Copini, Paul:Crivellaro, Alan:Delzon, Sylvain:Gebauer, Roman:Gričar, Jožica:Grönholm, Leila:Hölttä, Teemu:Jyske, Tuula:Lavrič, Martina:Lintunen, Anna:Lobo-do-Vale, Raquel:Peltoniemi, Mikko:Peters, Richard L.:Robert, Elisabeth M.

Nanofibers and Nanocomposite Films for Singlet Oxygen-Based Applications,"The development of photoactive nanomaterials producing singlet oxygen, 1O2, has blossomed as a field of great interest because of the ease with which their functionality is switched on and off by light, with a quick response, and their ability to do so without introducing other reactants into the system. In this chapter, we address the developing area of polymer nanofibers and nanocomposite films containing photosensitizers (PS) that are encapsulated or attached to the surface, with an emphasis on their photophysical properties, their ability to produce 1O2, and their potential use in constructing multifunctional platforms with photoantibacterial, photoantiviral, and photo-oxidative properties. Polymer nanofibers have several advantages over bulk polymers including their large specific surface area and high porosity, light weight, low cost, mechanical flexibility, light-transparency, and small diameters, which range from tens to hundreds of nanometers. The selection of polymers with high oxygen permeability and surface hydrophilicity (wettability) is crucial for achieving the efficient photo-oxidation effect of 1O2. Important experimental data that illuminate the correlation of these two parameters and performance are discussed, and examples from our laboratory and others are summarized. Potential directions for further developments are also highlighted.",10402.0,"Lang, Kamil:Mosinger, Jiří:Kubát, Pavel",Singlet Oxygen : Applications in Biosciences and Nanosciences,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tuning the photoluminescence and anisotropic structure of PEDOT,"In the current work, we study the photoluminescence and anisotropic structure of PEDOT which is obtained in the presence of ions that perturb the water structure (ions in Hofmeister series). The water content in PEDOT has been confirmed by TGA and DSC measurements. The weight loss and heat flux together provided refined information about water content in the synthesized PEDOT, and based on the characteristic energy value, we conclude that the water molecules are bonded to the PEDOT chains by hydrogen bonds. The physicochemical properties of the such prepared PEDOT have been studied, e.g. the presence of photoluminescence is observed for PEDOT in the solid-state (thin film) with the longest Stokes shift (273 nm). Similarly, photoluminescence has been detected for the aqueous PEDOT suspension with the lifetime of the excited state in the range of nanoseconds. Moreover, the PEDOT chains can undergo rearrangements under electrochemical performance with the formation of an anisotropic structure, which is confirmed by polarized microscopy and XRD measurements. The photoluminescence spectrum of the anisotropic PEDOT film contains sharp, well-resolved peaks.",10404.0,"Ivanko, Iryna:Pánek, Jiří:Svoboda, Jan:Zhigunov, Alexander:Tomšík, Elena",Journal of Materials Chemistry C,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Has 'Strict Liability' Given Way to a General 'Duty to Compensate Harm' in Czech Law?,"According to the new Civil Code, adopted in the Czech Republic in 2012 (&quot,2012 Civil Code&quot,), &apos,strict liability&apos, (or &apos,no-fault liability&apos,) is no longer considered &apos,liability&apos, in the traditional sense of the term. The declared concept of the Civil Code is based on the premise that the notion of &apos,liability&apos, should be limited only to cases where a person can be held liable based on their culpability (fault). All other cases, denoted by the doctrine as the opposite to &apos,fault-based liability&apos, (or more accurately, liability based on culpable conduct), that is, &apos,no-fault&apos, or &apos,strict&apos, liability, are - in actual fact - no longer conceived or designated by the Civil Code as &apos,liability&apos, (in Czech: odpovědnost). They are rather constructed as a legal duty to compensate harm. This begs the question whether unlawfulness can be considered a prerequisite for the duty to compensate harm. The authors argue that the answer to this question depends on what the unlawfulness relates to - whether an unlawful act or an unlawful state of affairs. Their argument builds on the premise that unlawful acts are linked to an individual&apos,s conduct, where both the reason and the will of the individual are present and, as a result, such unlawful acts are based on the individual&apos,s culpability (fault). On the other hand, what is typical of an unlawful state of affairs is that the law has been violated, not because someone acted contrary to it, but rather because the rights of the aggrieved party were infringed. The authors conclude that an unlawful state of affairs is a general legal fact which covers all cases of &apos,strict&apos, (or &apos,no-fault&apos,) liability and even a breach of contractual obligations. The authors develop their premise not only within Czech law, but also through comparison with other jurisdictions (France, Germany, and Austria), and analyze the potential of and limits to such approach.",50501.0,"Beran, Karel:Elischer, David",Review of Central and East European Law,3,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Myeloperoxidase mediated alteration of endothelial function is dependent on its cationic charge,"Endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx (GLX) comprise a multicomponent layer of pmteoglycans and glycoproteins. Alteration of its integrity contributes to chronic vascular inflammation and leads to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a highly abundant enzyme released by polymorphonuclear neutrophils, binds to the GLX and deleteriously affects vascular EC functions. The focus of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of MPO-mediated alteration of GLX molecules, and to unravel subsequent changes in endothelial integrity and function. MPO binding to GLX of human ECs and subsequent internalization was mediated by cell surface heparan sulfate chains. Moreover, interaction of MPO, which is carrying a cationic charge, with anionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) resulted in reduction of their relative charge. By means of micro-viscometry and atomic force microscopy, we disclosed that MPO can crosslink GAG chains. MPO-dependent modulation of GLX structure was further supported by alteration of wheat germ agglutinin staining. Increased expression of ICAM-1 documented endothelial cell activation by both catalytically active and also inactive MPO. Furthermore, MPO increased vascular permeability connected with reorganization of intracellular junctions, however, this was dependent on MPO's catalytic activity. Novel proteins interacting with MPO during transcytosis were identified by proteomic analysis. Altogether, these findings provide evidence that MPO through interaction with GAGs modulates overall charge of the GLX, causing modification of its structure and thus affecting EC function. Importantly, our results also suggest a number of proteins interacting with MPO that possess a variety of cellular localizations and functions.",10608.0,"Kolářová, Hana:Víteček, Jan:Černá, A.:Černík, Marek:Přibyl, J.:Skládal, P.:Potěšil, D.:Ihnatova, I.:Zdráhal, Z.:Hampl, A.:Klinke, A.:Kubala, Lukáš",Free Radical Biology and Medicine,3,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Application of orbitrap mass spectrometry for analysis of model bio-oil compounds and fast pyrolysis bio-oils from different biomass sources,"Pyrolysis bio-oils have great potential for the future use as biofuels and source of oxygenated chemicals. To optimize a pyrolysis process, detailed knowledge about the chemical composition of bio-oils is necessary. In recent years, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has successfully been used to the characterization of pyrolysis bio-oils from lignocellulosic biomass. This method enabled to detect thousands of semivolatile and nonvolatile, high-molecular-weight bio-oil compounds and provided partial information about their structure. In this work, we used high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry to characterize semivolatile and nonvolatile, high-molecular-weight compounds of four bio-oils obtained from the ablative flash pyrolysis of different biomass sources. Before the analyses of these bio-oils, we analyzed model bio-oil compounds and commercially available bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of wood using positive-ion and negative-ion electrospray (ESI) and positive-ion and negative-ion atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) orbitrap mass spectrometry and compared the results. Based on this comparison, a combination of negative-ion ESI and APCI was found to be well suited for the characterization of pyrolysis bio-oils, these techniques were thus used for the study of bio-oils from different biomass sources and the obtained results were compared. In the studied bio-oils, mostly compounds with 1?8 oxygen atoms per molecule were detected and their degree of unsaturation (DBE) was about 1?10 (negative-ion ESI) and 1?17 (negative-ion APCI), respectively. Among the studied bio-oils, the differences were observed mostly in abundances of their major compounds (compound classes). The analyses of model bio-oil compounds brought valuable information about their behavior during the HRMS characterization of bio-oils.",10406.0,"Staš, Martin:Chudoba, Josef:Auersvald, Miloš:Kubička, David:Conrad, Stefan:Schulzke, Tim:Pospíšil, Milan",JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Using Multispectral Remote Sensing Data: Prediction Ability of Data with Different Spatial and Spectral Resolutions,"The image spectral data, particularly hyperspectral data, has been proven as an efficient data source for mapping of the spatial variability of soil organic carbon (SOC). Multispectral satellite data are readily available and cost-effective sources of spectral data compared to costly and technically demanding processing of hyperspectral data. Moreover, their continuous acquisition allows to develop a composite from time-series, increasing the spatial coverage of SOC maps. In this study, an evaluation of the prediction ability of models assessing SOC using real multispectral remote sensing data from different platforms was performed. The study was conducted on a study plot (1.45 km2) in the Chernozem region of South Moravia (Czechia). The adopted methods included field sampling and predictive modeling using satellite multispectral Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PlanetScope data, and multispectral UAS Parrot Sequoia data. Furthermore, the performance of a soil reflectance composite image from Sentinel-2 data was analyzed. Aerial hyperspectral CASI 1500 and SASI 600 data was used as a reference. Random forest, support vector machine, and the cubist regression technique were applied in the predictive modeling. The prediction accuracy of models using multispectral data, including Sentinel-2 composite, was lower (RPD range from 1.16 to 1.65, RPIQ range from 1.53 to 2.17) compared to the reference model using hyperspectral data (RPD = 2.26, RPIQ = 3.34). The obtained results show very similar prediction accuracy for all spaceborne sensors (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PlanetScope). However, the spatial correlation between the reference mapping results obtained from the hyperspectral data and other maps using multispectral data was moderately strong. UAS sensors and freely available satellite multispectral data can represent an alternative cost-effective data source for remote SOC mapping on the local scale.",40104.0,"Žížala, Daniel:Minařík, Robert:Zádorová, Tereza",Remote sensing,3,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The High-Temperature Wear and Oxidation Behavior of CrC-Based HVOF Coatings,"Three commercially available chromium carbide-based powders with different kinds of matrix (Cr3C2-25%NiCr, Cr3C2-25%CoNiCrAlY and Cr3C2-50%NiCr-MoNb) were deposited by an HVOF JP-5000 spraying gun,evaluated and compared. The influence of heat treatment on the microstructure and properties, as well as the oxidation resistance in a hot steam environment (p = 24 MPa, T = 609 C), was evaluated by SEM and XRD with respect to their potential application in the steam power industry. The sliding wear resistance measured at room and elevated (T = 600 C) temperatures according to ASTM G-133. For all three kinds of chromium carbide-based coatings, the precipitation of secondary carbides from the supersaturated matrix was observed during the heat treatment. For Cr3C2-25%NiCr coating annealed in hot steam environment as well as for Cr3C2-25%CoNiCrAlY coating in both environments, the inner carbide oxidation was recorded. The sliding wear resistance was found equal at room temperature, regardless of the matrix composition and content, while at elevated temperatures, the higher wear was measured, varying in dependence on the matrix composition and content. The chromium carbide-based coating with modified matrix composition Cr3C2- 50%NiCrMoNb is suitable to replace the  Cr3C2-25%NiCr coating in a hot steam environment to eliminate the risk of failure caused by inner carbide oxidation.",20506.0,"Houdková Šimůnková, Šárka:Česánek, Zdeněk:Smazalová, Eva:Lukáč, František",Journal of Thermal Spray Technology,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Statistical treatment of grid indentation considering the effect of the interface and the microstructural length scale,"Statistical evaluation of grid indentation data is a well-known method used for determination of mechanical properties of multiphase materials. The statistical distribution of these type of data can be significantly influenced by the presence of an interface between adjacent phases. Consequently, the bias in mechanical properties (e.g. Young´s modulus, hardness), more pronounced for higher penetration depths, is usually observed. Using standard multimodal Gaussian distribution leads to underestimation of mechanical properties of harder/stiffer phases and vice versa. To eliminate this effect, statistical distribution taking into account the conditional probability of the indentation near the interface was developed and used in this case study on tungsten–copper composite. Using this approach, intrinsic material properties (Young´s modulus and hardness) of the individual phases were determined. Moreover, the contribution from the presence of the neighboring phase was separated and thus, so-called indentation size effect was successfully identified in individual phases of tungsten–copper composite.",20501.0,"Haušild, Petr:Čech, Jaroslav:Materna, Aleš:Matějíček, J.",Mechanics of Materials,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Dual Mode of the Saponin Aescin in Plant Protection: Antifungal Agent and Plant Defense Elicitor,"Being natural plant antimicrobials, saponins have potential for use as biopesticides. Nevertheless, their activity in plant-pathogen interaction is poorly understood. We performed a comparative study of saponins' antifungal activities on important crop pathogens based on their effective dose (EC50) values. Among those saponins tested, aescin showed itself to be the strongest antifungal agent. The antifungal effect of aescin could be reversed by ergosterol, thus suggesting that aescin interferes with fungal sterols. We tested the effect of aescin on plant-pathogen interaction in two different pathosystems: Brassica napus versus (fungus) Leptosphaeria maculans and Arabidopsis thaliana versus (bacterium) Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). We analyzed resistance assays, defense gene transcription, phytohormonal production, and reactive oxygen species production. Aescin activated B. napus defense through induction of the salicylic acid pathway and oxidative burst. This defense response led finally to highly efficient plant protection against L. maculans that was comparable to the effect of fungicides. Aescin also inhibited colonization of A. thaliana by Pst DC3000, the effect being based on active elicitation of salicylic acid (SA)-dependent immune mechanisms and without any direct antibacterial effect detected. Therefore, this study brings the first report on the ability of saponins to trigger plant immune responses. Taken together, aescin in addition to its antifungal properties activates plant immunity in two different plant species and provides SA-dependent resistance against both fungal and bacterial pathogens.",40106.0,"Trdá, Lucie:Janda, Martin:Macková, Denisa:Pospíchalová, Romana:Dobrev, Petre I.:Burketová, Lenka:Matušinsky, Pavel",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,3,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0
Iron overload reduces synthesis and elimination of bile acids in rat liver,"Excessive iron accumulation in the liver, which accompanies certain genetic or metabolic diseases, impairs bile acids (BA) synthesis, but the influence of iron on the complex process of BA homeostasis is unknown. Thus, we evaluated the effect of iron overload (IO) on BA turnover in rats. Compared with control rats, IO (8 intraperitoneal doses of 100 mg/kg every other day) significantly decreased bile flow as a consequence of decreased biliary BA secretion. This decrease was associated with reduced expression of Cyp7a1, the rate limiting enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to BA, and decreased expression of Bsep, the transporter responsible for BA efflux into bile. However, IO did not change net BA content in faeces in response to increased intestinal conversion of BA into hyodeoxycholic acid. In addition, IO increased plasma cholesterol concentrations, which corresponded with reduced Cyp7a1 expression and increased expression of Hmgcr, the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo cholesterol synthesis. In summary, this study describes the mechanisms impairing synthesis, biliary secretion and intestinal processing of BA during IO. Altered elimination pathways for BA and cholesterol may interfere with the pathophysiology of liver damage accompanying liver diseases with excessive iron deposition.",30104.0,"Prašnická, Alena:Laštůvková, Hana:Alaei Faradonbeh, Fatemeh:Cermanová, Jolana:Hroch, Miloš:Mokrý, Jaroslav:Doleželová, Eva:Pávek, Petr:Žížalová, Kateřina:Vítek, Libor:Nachtigal, Petr:Mičuda, Stanislav",Scientific Reports,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The evolution of early medieval Moravian axe-shaped currency bars through the perspective of an archaeological experiment,"The presented text attempts to assess the possibilities and limitations of processing Great Moravian currency bars (by domestic archaeologists traditionally called axe-shaped hryvnias) into the form of an end product – a tool in the form of an axe – using an archaeological experiment.

"A plant-based meal increases gastrointestinal hormones and satiety more than an energy- and macronutrient-matched processed-meat meal in T2D, obese, and healthy men: A three-group randomized crossover study","Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in regulation of glucose metabolism and satiety. We tested the acute effect of meal composition on these hormones in three population groups. A randomized crossover design was used to examine the effects of two energy- and macronutrient-matched meals: a processed-meat and cheese (M-meal) and a vegan meal with tofu (V-meal) on gastrointestinal hormones, and satiety in men with type 2 diabetes (T2D, n = 20), obese men (O, n = 20), and healthy men (H, n = 20). Plasma concentrations of glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP-1), amylin, and peptide YY (PYY) were determined at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min. Visual analogue scale was used to assess satiety. We used repeated-measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for statistical analysis. Postprandial secretion of GLP-1 increased after the V-meal in T2D (by 30.5%, 95%CI 21.2 to 40.7%, p &lt, 0.001) and H (by 15.8%, 95%CI 8.6 to 23.5%, p = 0.01).

Method for emissivity measurement of semitransparent coatings at ambient temperature,"Coatings deposited on a material surface are effective way of changing its surface properties. For increasing or decreasing radiation heat transfer, coatings with high or low emissivity are used. Measurement of spectral emissivity is a fundamental step to effective use of coatings for this application. Up to now the measurement methods are focused on bulk samples and mainly opaque ones. Here we present a method enabling measurement of emissivity of semitransparent coating itself, although it is deposited on a substrate. The method is based on measurement of transmittance and reflectance using an integration sphere system and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer for samples with two different coating thicknesses deposited on transparent substrates. Measured transmittance of the coating indicates spectral regions of potential emissivity differences using different substrates. From all the measured values, spectral emissivity can be characterized for different coating thicknesses. The spectral range of the method is from 2 um to 20 um. The measurement is done at ambient temperature enabling measurement of samples sensitive to heating like biomedical or nanocoatings. The method was validated on known bulk samples and an example of semitransparent coating measurement is shown on high-temperature high-emissivity coating.",20201.0,"Honnerová, Petra:Martan, Jiří:Veselý, Zdeněk:Honner, Milan",Scientific Reports,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Single-Atom (Iron-Based) Catalysts: Synthesis and Applications,"Supported single-metal atom catalysts (SACs) are constituted of isolated active metal centers, which are heterogenized on inert supports such as graphene, porous carbon, and metal oxides. Their thermal stability, electronic properties, and catalytic activities can be controlled via interactions between the single-metal atom center and neighboring heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Due to the atomic dispersion of the active catalytic centers, the amount of metal required for catalysis can be decreased, thus offering new possibilities to control the selectivity of a given transformation as well as to improve catalyst turnover frequencies and turnover numbers. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the synthesis of Fe-SACs with a focus on anchoring single atoms (SA) on carbon/graphene supports.

"The compound synangial organ Potoniea krisiae sp. nov. and its plausible relationship with linopterids based on cuticles from the Late Pennsylvanian Sydney Coalfield, Canada","Seven compression fossils of the compound synangial organ Potoniea sensu stricto are reported for the first time from Cantabrian-aged (late Moscovian) strata in the Sydney Coalfield, Nova Scotia, Canada. They occurred at a single locality, mostly in the proximo-distal repose position clearly showing sporangia overextending the distalproximal surfaces, and with one specimen laterally compressed. Specimens were studied under SEM and sporangia were macerated to reveal in situ microspores. The organs are characterized as a compound synangial organs consisting a very narrow stalk, vascularized proximal cap and an outer cover of sporangial parts. Long, cylindrical sporangia are grouped with synangia, terminating as free sporangial tips that extend from the distal surface of the compound synangial organ. Sporangia are densely filled with trilete, verrucate to rugulate microspores of the Verrucosisporites type. Taxonomically significant is the potential of using the cuticles from the cap of the compound synangial organ that have continuously thick bifurcating veins and stomata to link with the associated linopterid foliar taxa Linopteris and Alethopteris./i, occurring within the Sydney Coalfield. Problems are encountered from the non-availability of linopterid cuticles and the poor preservation of Potoniea cuticles.

Alien plant invasions in European woodlands,"Aim: Woodlands make up a third of European territory and carry out important ecosystem functions, yet a comprehensive overview of their invasion by alien plants has never been undertaken across this continent. Location: Europe. Methods: We extracted data from 251,740 vegetation plots stored in the recently compiled European Vegetation Archive. After filtering (resulting in 83,396 plots, 39 regions, 1970–2015 time period), we analysed the species pool and frequency of alien vascular plants with respect to geographic origin and life-forms, and the levels of invasion across the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) woodland habitats. Results: We found a total of 386 alien plant species (comprising 7% of all recorded vascular plants). Aliens originating from outside of and from within Europe were almost equally represented in the species pool (192 vs. 181 species) but relative frequency was skewed towards the former group (77% vs. 22%) due, to some extent, to the frequent occurrence of Impatiens parviflora (21% frequency among alien plants). Phanerophytes were the most species-rich life-form (148 species) and had the highest representation in terms of relative frequency (39%) among aliens in the dataset. Apart from Europe (181 species), North America was the most important source of alien plants (109 species). At the local scale, temperate and boreal softwood riparian woodland (5%) and mire and mountain coniferous woodland (&lt,1%) had the highest and lowest mean relative alien species richness (percentage of alien species per plot), respectively. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that European woodlands are prone to alien plant invasions especially when exposed to disturbance, fragmentation, alien propagule pressure and high soil nutrient levels. Given the persistence of these factors in the landscape, competitive alien plant species with a broad niche, including alien trees and shrubs, are likely to persist and spread further into European woodlands.",10600.0,"Wagner, Viktoria:Chytrý, Milan:Jiménez Alfaro González, Francisco De Borja:Pergl, Jan:Hennekens, Stephan:Biurrun, Idoia:Knollová, Ilona:Berg, Christian:Vassilev, Kiril:Rodwell, John S.:Škvorc, Željko:Jandt, Ute:Ewald, Jörg:Jansen, Florian:Tsiripidis, Ioannis:Botta-Dukát, Zoltán:Casella, Laura:Attorre, Fabio:Rašomavičius, Valerijus:Čušterevska, Renata:Schaminée, Joop H.J.:Brunet, Jörg:Lenoir, Jonathan:Svenning, Jens-Christian:Kacki, Zygmunt Walerian:Petrášová-Šibíková, Mária:Šilc, Urban:García-Mijangos, Itziar:Campos, Juan Antonio:Fernández-González, Federico:Wohlgemuth, Thomas:Onyshchenko, Viktor:Pyšek, Petr",Diversity and Distributions,3,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

The Stripping of His Charms. The Stability and Transformation of Oldřich Nový's Star Image 1936-1955,"Although still visible and a prominent part of nostalgic reminiscences of the First Republic, star identities were never until recently subjected to academic scrutiny. Throughout the 1930s and during the war years, the star system was crucial for the local film industry. Similarly to various forms of European stardom, celebrated Czechoslovak performers fulfilled two important functions. First, they served as a major crowd-puller, securing domestic and in some rare cases even international revenues, and second, the stars stood for a culturally important product. Although the whole concept of stardom seemed endangered due to nationalisation of the film industry, and especially after the Communist putsch in February 1948, a practice of evaluating and selecting the best performers persisted, with a new set of criteria. The case of Oldřich Nový allowed me to address the topic of the stability versus the transformation of star images in an era which generally was not at all favourable to stardom. The chapter thus sheds a much needed scholarly light on the demise of Czechoslovak prewar stardom, undermining the myth of the total elimination of a whole generation of celebrated performers.",60405.0,"Gmiterková, Šárka",Popular Cinemas in East Central Europe : Film Cultures and Histories,3,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sustainable waste-to-energy facility location: Influence of demand on energy sales,"Waste-to-Energy facility location with practical insights into its economic sustainability is assessed by two mathematical models. The first model minimising transportation and investment costs leads to a mixed-integer linear problem, for which commercial solvers perform very well. However, economic performance, which is needed for long-term projects requiring large investments, is not met when the capacity of the plant is not fully utilised. This can be resolved by a revenue model defining gate fees for potential plant capacities. Therefore, a second model including penalty co st functions associated with reduced energy sales and unutilised capacity of plants is developed. This leads to a non-linear model where solvers perform well for small and medium-size instances and so a modified meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed. Both models are applied to data from the Czech Republic. Insights into performance of the models and their economical sustainability using demand influence on the energy sales are provided. While the solution of the linear model proposes a higher number of facilities with less total capacity repletion, the non-linear model suggests a smaller number of facilities with higher total repletion presenting a reasonable sustainable solution.

Small Amounts of Inorganic Nitrate or Beetroot Provide Substantial Protection From Salt-Induced Increases in Blood Pressure,"To reduce the risk of salt-induced hypertension, medical authorities have emphasized dietary guidelines promoting high intakes of potassium and low intakes of salt that provide molar ratios of potassium to salt of >= 1:1. However, during the past several decades, relatively few people have changed their eating habits sufficiently to reach the recommended dietary goals for salt and potassium. Thus, new strategies that reduce the risk of salt-induced hypertension without requiring major changes in dietary habits would be of considerable medical interest. In the current studies in a widely used model of salt-induced hypertension, the Dahl salt-sensitive rat, we found that supplemental dietary sodium nitrate confers substantial protection from initiation of salt-induced hypertension when the molar ratio of added nitrate to added salt is only approximate to 1:170. Provision of a low molar ratio of added nitrate to added salt of approximate to 1:110 by supplementing the diet with beetroot also conferred substantial protection against salt-induced increases in blood pressure. The results suggest that on a molar basis and a weight basis, dietary nitrate may be approximate to 100x more potent than dietary potassium with respect to providing substantial resistance to the pressor effects of increased salt intake. Given that leafy green and root vegetables contain large amounts of inorganic nitrate, these findings raise the possibility that fortification of salty food products with small amounts of a nitrate-rich vegetable concentrate may provide a simple method for reducing risk for salt-induced hypertension.",30201.0,"Morris Jr., R.

"The behaviour of hyaluronan solutions in the presence of Hofmeister ions: A light scattering, viscometry and surface tension study","Dynamic light scattering (DLS), viscosity and surface tension (SFT) measurements were used to characterize influence of salts containing ions of Hofmeister series (Na 2 SO 4 , (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , NaSCN, NH 4 SCN and NaCl) on the behaviour of hyaluronan in diluted solutions at a temperature range of 15–45 °C. The results of the study showed that chaotropic and kosmotropic ions notably influenced the folding and unfolding of hyaluronan coils due to interactions between a respective ion and hydrophilic or hydrophobic patches present in the backbone of the polymer chains. This was mainly proved by viscosity and light scattering measurements. The temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic diameter of the hyaluronan coil determined by DLS demonstrated that combinations of chaotropic and kosmotropic ions in one salt (NaCl, NaSCN and (HN 4 ) 2 SO 4 ) can stabilize the size of the coil in a wide range of temperatures.

Comparison of PM2.5 Chemical Composition and Sources at a Rural Background Site in Central Europe between 1993/1994/1995 and 2009/2010: Effect of Legislative Regulations and Economic Transformation on the Air Quality.,"From December 1993 to January 1995 and from October 2009 to October 2010, a total of 320 and 365 daily samples of the PM2.5 were collected at a rural background site (National Atmospheric Observatory Košetice) in Central Europe. The PM2.5 samples were analyzed for 29 and 26 elements respectively by Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) and water-soluble inorganic ions by Ion Chromatography (IC) in 2009/2010. The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was applied to the chemical composition of PM2.5 to determine its sources. The decreasing trends of almost all elements concentrations, especially the metals regulated by the EU Directive (2004/107/EC) are evident. The annual median ratios indicate a decrease in concentrations of the PM2.5 elements. The slight increase of K concentrations and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rs 0.09 K/Se points to a rise in residential wood combustion. The S concentrations are nearly comparable (higher mean in 2009/2010, while the annual median ratio is under 1). The five major source types in the mid-1990s were ascribed to brown coal combustion, oil combustion, sea salt and dust – long-range transport, re-suspended dust and black coal combustion. The industrial combustion of brown and/or black coal (rs 0.75 Se/As, rs 0.57 Ga/Ge and rs 0.20 As/Zn) and oil (rs 0.72 V/Ni) of the regional origin dominated. In the 1990s, the potential source regions were the border area of Czech Republic, German and Poland (brown coal), the Moravia-Silesia region at the Czech-Polish border (black coal), and Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, and the Balkans (oil). In 2009/2010, the apportioned sources were sulfate, residential heating, nitrate, industry, re-suspended dust, and sea salt and dust – long-range transport. The secondary sulfate from coal combustion and residential biomass burning (rs 0.96, K/K+) of local origin dominated. The declining trend of the elemental concentrations and change in the source pattern of the regional background PM2.5 in Central Europe between the mid-1990s and 2009/10 reflects the economic transformation and impact of stricter legislation in Central Europe.",10509.0,"Pokorná, Petra:Schwarz, Jaroslav:Krejčí, R.:Swietlicki, E.:Havránek, Vladimír:Ždímal, Vladimír",Environmental Pollution,3,low,high,0,1,low,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Highly porous, low elastic modulus 316L stainless steel scaffold prepared by selective laser melting","Recently, porous metallic materials have been extensively studied as candidates for use in the fabrication of scaffolds and augmentations to repair trabecular bone defects, e.g. in surroundings of joint replacements. Fabricating these complex structures by using common approaches (e.g., casting and machining) is very challenging. Therefore, rapid prototyping techniques, such as selective laser melting (SLM), have been investigated for these applications. In this study, we characterized a highly porous (87 vol.%) 316L stainless steel scaffold prepared by SLM. 316L steel was chosen because it presents a biomaterial still widely used for fabrication of joint replacements and, from the practical point of view, use of the same material for fabrication of an augmentation and a joint replacement is beneficial for corrosion prevention. The results are compared to the reported properties of two representative nonporous 316L stainless steels prepared either by SLM or casting and subsequent hot forging. The microstructural and mechanical properties and the surface chemical composition and interaction with the cells were investigated. The studied material exhibited mechanical properties that were similar to those of trabecular bone (compressive modulus of elasticity similar to 0.15 GPa, compressive yield strength similar to 3 MPa) and cytocompatibility after one day that was similar to that of wrought 316L stainless steel, which is a commonly used biomaterial. Based on the obtained results, SLM is a suitable method for the fabrication of porous 316L stainless steel scaffolds with highly porous structures.",0.0,"Čapek, Jaroslav:Machová, Markéta:Fousová, Michaela:Kubásek, Jiří:Vojtěch, Dalibor:Fojt, Jaroslav:Jablonská, Eva:Lipov, Jan:Ruml, Tomáš",Materials science and engineering C,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Role of Physical Education Lessons and Recesses in School Lifestyle of Adolescents,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates school lifestyle among adolescents in terms of physical activity (PA) structure: (1) adolescents participating in a physical education lesson (PEL) versus (2) aggregate recess time exceeding 60minutes. METHODS: The research was conducted in 24 secondary schools in the Czech Republic (boys N=208, girls N=433). For the whole day (1-3 days) participants wore the ActiTrainer accelerometer, which monitored PA, and heart rate. A total of 1122 school days were recorded. RESULTS: Both boys and girls participating in a PEL reported signiﬁcantly better results compared with nonparticipating individuals regarding all indicators of volume and intensity of school PA (SPA). In most SPA indicators, longer aggregate recess time (>60minutes) had a statistically signiﬁcant effect, particularly on the volume of SPA. The recommended 500 steps/hours for SPA was achieved by 83% of boys participating in PEL and 69% of girls. In contrast just 32% of nonparticipating boys and 31% of girls reached this level. With longer recess time the recommendation was met by 43% of boys (42% of girls) compared with 26% of boys (23% of girls) with shorter recess time. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in SPA and an improved lifestyle in adolescents on school days are signiﬁcantly supported more by PELs than by longer recess time.",0.0,"Frömel, Karel:Svozil, Zbyněk:Chmelík, František:Jakubec, Lukáš:Groffik, Dorota",Journal of School Health,3,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Investigation of Structure-Activity Relationships of Dexrazoxane Analogs Reveals Topoisomerase II beta Interaction as a Prerequisite for Effective Protection against Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity,"Bisdioxopiperazine agent dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) has been the only effective and approved drug for prevention of chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity. However, the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of its cardioprotective effects remain obscure owing to limited investigation of its derivatives/analogs and uncertainties about its mechanism of action. To fill these knowledge gaps, we tested the hypothesis that dexrazoxane derivatives exert cardioprotection via metal chelation and/or modulation of topoisomerase II beta (Top2B) activity in chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Dexrazoxane was alkylated in positions that should not interfere with the metal-chelating mechanism of cardioprotective action, that is, on dioxopiperazine imides or directly on the dioxopiperazine ring. The protective effects of these agents were assessed in vitro in neonatal cardiomyocytes. All studied modifications of dexrazoxane molecule, including simple methylation, were found to abolish the cardioprotective effects. Because this challenged the prevailing mechanistic concept and previously reported data, the two closest derivatives [(+/-)-4,4&apos,-(propane-1,2-diyl)bis(1-methylpiperazine-2,6-dione) and 4-(2-(3,5-dioxopiperazin-1-yl)ethyl)-3-methylpiperazine-2,6-dione] were thoroughly scrutinized in vivo using a rabbit model of chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity. contrast to dexrazoxane, both compounds failed to protect the heart, as demonstrated by mortality, cardiac dysfunction, and myocardial damage parameters, although the pharmacokinetics and metal-chelating properties of their metabolites were comparable to those of dexrazoxane. The loss of cardiac protection was shown to correlate with their abated potential to inhibit and deplete Top2B both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest a very tight SAR between bisdioxopiperazine derivatives and their cardioprotective effects and support Top2B as a pivotal upstream druggable target for effective cardioprotection against anthracycline cardiotoxicity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study has revealed the previously unexpected tight structure-activity relationships of cardioprotective effects in derivatives of dexrazoxane, which is the only drug approved for the prevention of cardiomyopathy and heart failure induced by anthracycline anticancer drugs. The data presented in this study also strongly argue against the importance of metalchelating mechanisms for the induction of this effect and support the viability of topoisomerase II beta as an upstream druggable target for effective and clinically translatable cardioprotection.",30104.0,"Kollárová Brázdová, Petra:Jirkovská, Anna:Karabanovich, Galina:Pokorná, Zuzana:Bavlovič Piskáčková, Hana:Jirkovský, Eduard:Kubeš, Jan:Lenčová-Popelová, Olga:Mazurová, Yvona:Adamcová, Michaela:Skalická, Veronika:Štěrbová, Petra:Roh, Jaroslav:Šimůnek, Tomáš:Štěrba, Martin",Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,3,high,high,1,1,low,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Identifying Locations along Railway Networks with the Highest Tree Fall Hazard,"Disruptions of railway traffic have many reasons. Tree falls onto railway tracks or overhead lines rank among the most common causes of disruptions of a natural origin. 2039 tree-fall events, containing up to 70 individual trees per event, were registered on the Czech railway network between 2012 and 2015. 32% of them were directly caused by 14 weather extremes during which more than 20 concurrent tree-fall events were registered. Moreover, 12 train derailments due to fallen trees were registered on Czech railways within the same period.  We combined land use data along railway tracks and data on tree falls. Land use and railway tracks data were obtained from a freely available Open Street Map database. The tree fall hazard was then computed using empirical data, data on land use and a generalized rule of succession. The clustering approach was also applied to focus on localities where tree falls were concentrated regardless of the resulting segment hazard. There were 59 rail track segments (out of 2960) with the highest tree fall hazard and 267 clusters were finally identified. The clusters and the most hazardous railway segments will be among the first in the process of line side vegetation monitoring in order to minimize potential losses from tree fall.

Na+/K+-ATPase and lipid peroxidation in forebrain cortex and hippocampus of sleep-deprived rats treated with therapeutic lithium concentration for different periods of time,"Lithium (Li) is a typical mood stabilizer and the first choice for treatment of bipolar disorder (BD). Despite an extensive clinical use of Li, its mechanisms of action remain widely different and debated. In this work, we studied the time-course of the therapeutic Li effects on ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase in forebrain cortex and hippocampus of rats exposed to 3-day sleep deprivation (SD). We also monitored lipid peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) production. In samples of plasma collected from all experimental groups of animals, Li concentrations were followed by ICP-MS. The acute (1 day), short-term (7 days) and chronic (28 days) treatment of rats with Li resulted in large decrease of Na+/K+-ATPase activity in both brain parts. At the same time, SD of control, Li-untreated rats increased Na+/K+-ATPase along with increased production of MDA. The SD-induced increase of Na+/K+-ATPase and MDA was attenuated in Li-treated rats. While SD results in a positive change of Na+/K+-ATPase, the inhibitory effect of Li treatment may be interpreted as a pharmacological mechanism causing a normalization of the stress-induced shift and return the Na+/K+-ATPase back to control level. We conclude that SD alone up-regulates Na+/K+-ATPase together with increased peroxidative damage of lipids. Chronic treatment of rats with Li before SD, protects the brain tissue against this type of damage and decreases Na+/K+-ATPase level back to control level.",30105.0,"Vošahlíková, Miroslava:Roubalová, Lenka:Cechová, Kristína:Kaufman, Jonáš:Musil, Stanislav:Mikšík, Ivan:Alda, M.:Svoboda, Petr",Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry,3,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great Middle Eastern Instability : Structural roots and uneven modernization 1960-2012,"The paper deals with the structural roots of political instability in the Middle East that has been manifested by the Arab Spring throughout the region since early 2011. The roots of the instability are seen in cumulative effects of highly uneven long-term social change in its three main dimensions since 1960s: (1) rapid social and demographic changes, (2) slower and fluctuating economic development, and (3) rigid political subsystem. The Middle Eastern uneven social change is also under way in a specific (4) cultural and (5) international context. The political instability is thus seen as a consequence of multiple and complex interactions among various dimensions of uneven modernisation process, Islamic political imagination and the international context. The paper deals with the interactions on the macro-level and with its politically destabilizing consequences on micro-level using selected examples of causal mechanisms. The Middle Eastern uneven modernisation pattern is systematically documented by empirical macro-indicators and is compared with the modernisation process in other post-colonial world macro-regions.",50401.0,"Černý, Karel",Journal of Historical Sociology,3,medium,high,1,0,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Using proteomics to identify host cell interaction partners for VgrG and IglJ,"Francisella tularensis is a highly virulent intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of tularemia. The disease is characterized by the suboptimal innate immune response and consequently by the impaired adaptive immunity. The virulence of this pathogen depends on proteins encoded by a genomic island termed the Francisella Pathogenicity Island (FPI). However, the precise biological roles of most of the FPI-encoded proteins remain to be clarified. In this study, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with affinity protein purification coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify potential protein-effector binding pairs for two FPI virulence effectors IglJ and VgrG. Our results may indicate that while the IglJ protein interactions primarily affect mitochondria, the VgrG interactions affect phagosome and/or autophagosome biogenesis via targeting components of the host's exocyst complex.",10700.0,"Prokšová, Magdaléna:Řehulková, Helena:Řehulka, Pavel:Lays, Claire:Lenčo, Juraj:Stulík, Jiří",Scientific Reports,3,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Potential reduction in mortality associated with the shifts of population educational structures in the Czech Republic,"Educational inequalities in mortality are large in Central and Eastern Europe. Mortality levels are particularly high among low educated men as well as women in the Czech Republic. However, differences in male mortality by educational attainment exceed those of females. Two mortality patterns are apparent when dividing the Czech classification of education into four categories-basic, vocational, secondary, and university. Males with basic education experience much higher mortality when compared to their higher educated counterparts. An anomaly in the mortality gradient is observed among women when comparing basic and vocational education. Women with basic education show a rather lower mortality level compared to their vocational counterparts. Three scenarios show how the shifts toward a higher education could contribute to the change in mortality level using temporary life expectancies between ages 30 and 80 for males and females: (a) population structure by sex, age, and education remains the same as from the census 2011, (b) 60% of males having the basic education move into the next higher category (vocational) and 60% of women with basic and vocational education move into the secondary education, and (3) sex age education-specific mortality rates will be shifted upwards by one level.",50402.0,"Rychtaříková, Jitka:Hulíková Tesárková, Klára",Senescence - Physiology or Pathology,3,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Biomonitoring of PFOA, PFOS and PFNA in human milk from Czech Republic, time trends and estimation of infant's daily intake","Background: Perfluoralkylated substances (PFASs) are persistent and bioaccumulative environmental contaminants. They are included on the list of emergent compounds monitored in the frame of HBM4EU project. Objectives: To analyze PFASs levels in human milk samples collected in the period 2006 through 2017, to follow their time trends, to assess the PFASs exposure in breastfed infants, to calculate the daily intake of PFASs and to compare it with the tolerable daily/weekly) intakes and to quantify risk from exposure using the hazard quotient and hazard index approach. Material and methods: A broad spectrum of PFASs were analyzed by means of UHPLC-MS/MS in primipara human milk samples collected in four consecutive time periods 2006, 2010/11, 2014, and 2017, N = 46, 183, 164 and 232, respectively. Mothers living in urban and suburban residences were recruited after their delivery at maternity hospitals, and milk samples were taken within 2 and 8 weeks after delivery. The questionnaire was focused on possible sources of exposure, dietary habits and lifestyle. Results: Only perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoid acid PFOA (in 2017, also perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)) were quantified in more than 90% of analyzed human milk samples. In all sampling periods, the levels of PFOA were higher than those of PFOS (p &lt, 0.05). A significant downward temporal trend (p &lt, 0.001) was observed for both PFOA and PFOS levels. The median concentrations in sampling years 2006, 2010/11, 2014, and 2017 were 0.075, 0.059, 0.035, and 0.023 ng/mL for PFOA and 0.045, 0.031, 0.029, and 0.020 ng/mL for PFOS, respectively. In 2017, PFNA was also quantified in 99% of samples with the median concentration of 0.007 ng/mL. The levels of PFASs correlated with maternal sea fish consumption. No maternal age-related relationship was observed. Using the tolerably daily intake (TDI) values for PFOS and PFOA set by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2008, the calculated daily intakes from breastfeeding were clearly below these limits. Using the new, more conservative EFSA Provisional Tolerably Weekly Intake (PTWI) values set in 2018, we demonstrated a considerable exceedance of PTWI, with a hazard index above 1. Conclusion: Significant time-related decreasing trends in the PFOS and PFOA levels in human milk were observed. Nevertheless, the body burden of infants from breastfeeding might pose an enhanced health risk to infants when the current PTWI values are applied. These findings strongly support the present EU efforts to phase out PFOA, its salts and PFOA related compounds. Since PFOS exposure there has still been widely detected despite PFOS usage reduction measures, the major exposure routes should be further monitored and, if possible, eliminated.",30304.0,"Černá, Milena:Pinkr-Grafnetterová, Anna:Dvořáková, Darina:Pulkrabová, Jana:Malý, Marek:Janoš, Tomáš:Vodrážková, Nicole:Tupá, Zdeňka:Puklová, Vladimíra",Environmental Research,3,low,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0
Supported Lipid Bilayers on Fluorescent Nanodiamonds: A Structurally Defined and Versatile Coating for Bioapplications,"Fluorescent nanodiamonds with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers respond to local changes in electric and magnetic fields. These responses can be read optically as changes in fluorescence. NV centers do not suffer from photoblinking or photobleaching, making nanodiamonds a viable platform for long-term imaging of processes inside living cells. However, for any bioapplication, the surface of these particles must be modified to prevent aggregation and nonspecific protein adsorption and to effectively transduce the changes in local environment to NV center. Modular biomimetic interface has been developed on nanodiamonds with remarkable sensitivity for relaxometric readout that takes advantage of self-assembled phospholipid bilayers supported by the nanoparticle surface. This rapid and robust approach provides synthetic pathway to tunable composition, demonstrated by tuning surface charge and content of spin labels on nanodiamond. The supported phospholipid bilayer interface increases the detection sensitivity about one-order-of-magnitude. Also, a theoretical model of the system is provided, which shows excellent agreement with experimental results. Merging biocompatibility, modularity, and outstanding spin sensitivity in one nanomaterial provides a foundation for development of multifunctional nanoparticles suitable for highly sensitive monitoring of local magnetic field fluctuations and paramagnetic species under physiological conditions.",10610.0,"Vávra, Jan:Řehoř, Ivan:Rendler, T.:Jani, Mona:Bednár, J.:Baksh, M.

Quantitative Analysis of Pyrolysis Bio-oils: A Review,"Pyrolysis bio-oils are liquid products of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis. They have a highly promising potential to be widely used, after an appropriate upgrade, as advanced biofuels, or as a source of valuable oxygen-containing chemicals. The chemical composition of bio-oils is very complicated as they contain thousands of different, mostly oxygen-containing, compounds with a wide distribution of physical and chemical properties, and concentrations. Detailed knowledge of the bio-oil composition is crucial in order to optimize the pyrolysis processes and/or the subsequent bio-oil upgrading processes. The main challenge in bio-oil analytics is the identification and quantification of the individual compounds as well as the quantification of the total content of the compounds with the characteristic functional groups. In this review, we will discuss a state-of-the-art quantitative analysis of bio-oils and formulate strategies for obtaining in-depth information on the composition of the bio-oils and/or the products of their upgrading. Thermic, non-catalytic fast pyrolysis bio-oils and their hydrotreated analogues are of interest of this review. The emphasis will be placed on the quantification of the compounds with the key oxygen-containing functional groups present in the bio-oils including aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, phenols, carbohydrates, etc. Also, methods for the quantification of the individual compounds will be presented. Hence, this overview and critical assessment of the quantitative methods can help the researchers to better understand the results obtained by these methods and formulate strategies and goals for further research.

Aberrant apolipoprotein C-III glycosylation in glycogen storage disease type III and IX,"Introduction: Apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC-III) is a mostly liver-derived serum O-glycoprotein, which is used, along with an N-glycoprotein transferrin (TF), as a marker in the biochemical screening for congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). However, it is increasingly evident that secondary glycosylation abnormalities might occur in other, non-CDG metabolic diseases. Material and Methods: Here we examined the glycosylation status of serum TF and Apo-CIII by isoelectric focusing, SDS-PAGE and MALDI TOE mass spectrometry in our group of 24 patients with various types of glycogen storage disorders (GSD, types 0. Ia. non-Ia, III and IX). Results: While in GSD types la and non-la we found variable and mild ApoC-III hyposialylation, GSD types III and IX showed significantly aberrant ApoC-III glycosylation with a characteristic relative increase of its aglycosylated form. No correlation was found between ApoC-III sialylation and triglyceridemia within the analyzed group. Conclusions: Due to a lack of an enzymatic assay for GSD type III and a certain unreliability of the assay for GSD type IX, our finding could help clinicians in differential diagnosis to better target and select appropriate genetic analysis for the suspected patients. We hypothesize that the detected profound ApoC-III hypoglycosylation in these two disorders results from reduced availability of the nucleotide-monosaccharides, specifically UDP-GaINAc, in the corresponding glycosylation reactions.",30202.0,"Ondrušková, Nina:Honzík, Tomáš:Kolářová, Hana:Pakanova, Zuzana:Mucha, Jan:Zeman, Jiří:Hansíková, Hana",Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental,3,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Decoration of Inorganic Substrates with Metallic Nanoparticles and Their Application as Antimicrobial Agents,"materials is described in our chapter. The substrates for functional antimicrobial particles are natural clay minerals and carbon materials for this review limited to graphite/graphene and carbon nanoparticles (nanotubes and fullerenes). Short description of substrate materials and their properties is followed by discussion of the effect of selected most popular antimicrobial metals (silver, copper) and several oxides (zinc, titanium and copper oxides) and it is conferred for Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains. The methods for preparation of such particles may vary but the most used are intercalation and decoration methods from solution for the clay minerals. Nanoparticles (NPs) of metals and metal oxides on carbon and nanocarbon materials are prepared using physico-chemical approach. The research confirmed that the shape and size of functional NPs can depend on used substrate, preparation conditions and used method. Interestingly, it was found that Ag-clay sample was as effective as the free Ag+ions. Generally, it was found the size of active surface area, mobility and availability of potential active particles (ions or nanoparticles) and chemical state of them plays an important role in antimicrobial activity.",21001.0,"Hundáková, Marianna:Dědková, Kateřina:Simha Martynková, Gražyna",Metal Nanoparticles in Pharma,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cell membrane nanostructure is altered by heat-induced antigen retrieval:A possible consequence for immunocytochemical detection of membranous antigens,"Heat-induced antigen retrieval (HIAR) improves immunodetection of antigens in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples and it can also improve detection especially of intracellular antigens in alcohol-fixed cytological samples although it can have deleterious effect especially for membranous antigens. We examined the differences in cell surface topography by atomic force microscopy on methanol:aceton- (M:A) and 4% paraformaldehyde (4% PFA)-fixed MCF7 cells and changes caused by HIAR at three different temperatures (60, 90, 120°C). Moreover, the consequences for immunostaining of five membranous antigens (EGFR, E-cadherin, CD9, CD24 and CD44) were examinated. Our result showed that albeit there is no optimal immunostaining condition for our tested antibodies, the surface topography could be one of the important factors. Generally, the best conditions for successful immunostaining are M:A fixation with no HIAR treatment whereas in 4% PFA-fixed cells HIAR 120 is optimal. These conditions showed similarity in cell surface skewness which indicates with correlation factor 0.8000 between successful ICC staining and skewness parameter. It indicates that presence of valleys, depressions, scratches and pits on cell surface represents unfavourable condition for successful immunodetection of cell surface antigens.",30106.0,"Čížková, Kateřina:Malohlava, Jakub:Tauber, Zdeněk",Microscopy and Microanalysis,3,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Poor and vulnerable households in private renting,"This chapter demonstrates that market (private) tenants differ from the rest of the population in almost all former post-socialist EU member states by their lower age and higher odds of being unemployed. However, in most countries in the sample the majority of most poor and vulnerable households tend to be homeowners or public tenants rather than tenants in private rental housing. When dwellings are offered by the private sector as rentable housing for the poor, they are often of substandard quality and located in segregated areas. Informality, very low tenure security, short-term tenure, spatial segregation, and sometimes overpricing are significant barriers to the wider use of the private rental sector to house vulnerable households in post-socialist countries.",50401.0,"Lux, Martin:Teller, N.:Sunega, Petr",Private rental housing in transition countries: an alternative to owner occupation?,3,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Aging of polymers of intrinsic microporosity tracked by methanol vapour permeation,"The initially very promising transport properties of glassy high free volume polymers deteriorate rapidly over time. In this work, we focused on this aging phenomenon in two polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), namely PIM-1 and PIM-EA-TB. To identify the main mechanisms involved, we studied the time declines of permeability and diffusivity of methanol vapours in flat membranes with approximately equal thicknesses. The permeation measurements were carried out using a continuous flow permeation method with carrier gas, where the methanol vapours were held at constant activity 0.2 at 25 degrees C. Two different experimental modes were used: (i) continuous experiments that consisted of one long experiment with a duration of over 650 h for each polymer and (ii) momentary experiments that consisted of a vast number of short (ca. 6 h) consecutive measurements of transient permeation. The observed decreases of methanol permeability due to aging were more intense in the case of continuous mode for both polymers. In other words, the aging was ca. 1.3 times faster in the continuous mode in comparison with the momentary mode. Using time-aging time superposition, we successfully predicted the continuous experiments from the momentary experiments.",0.0,"Pilnáček, Kryštof:Vopička, Ondřej:Lanč, Marek:Dendisová, Marcela:Zgažar, Miroslav:Budd, Peter M.:Carta, Mariolino:Malpass-Evans, Richard:McKeown, Neil B.:Friess, Karel",Journal of Membrane Science,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Benzo[a]pyrene in the Ambient Air in the Czech Republic: Emission Sources, Current and Long-Term Monitoring Analysis and Human Exposure","This paper provides a detailed, thorough analysis of air pollution by benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the Czech Republic. The Czech residential sector is responsible for more than 98.8% of BaP, based on the national emission inventory. According to the data from 48 sites of the National Air Quality Monitoring Network, the range of annual average concentration of BaP ranges from 0.4 ng·m−3 at a rural regional station to 7.7 ng·m−3 at an industrial station. Additionally, short-term campaign measurements in small settlements have recorded high values of daily benzo[a]pyrene concentrations (0.1–13.6 ng·m−3) in winter months linked to local heating of household heating. The transboundary contribution to the annual average concentrations of BaP was estimated by the CAMx model to range from 46% to 70% over most of the country. However, the contribution of Czech sources can exceed 80% in residential heating hot spots. It is likely that the transboundary contribution to BaP concentrations was overestimated by a factor of 1.5 due to limitations of the modeling approach used. During the period of 2012–2018, 35–58% of the urban population in the Czech Republic were exposed to BaP concentrations above target. A significant decreasing trend, estimated by the Mann-Kendall test, was found for annual and winter BaP concentrations between 2008 and 2018.",10509.0,"Schreiberová, Markéta:Vlasáková, Leona:Vlček, Ondřej:Šmejdířová, Jana:Horálek, Jan",ATMOSPHERE,3,low,high,0,0,medium,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Crosstalk between ORMDL3, serine palmitoyltransferase, and 5-lipoxygenase in the sphingolipid and eicosanoid metabolic pathways","Leukotrienes (LTs) and sphingolipids are critical lipid mediators participating in numerous cellular signal transduction events and developing various disorders, such as bronchial hyperactivity leading to asthma. Enzymatic reactions initiating production of these lipid mediators involve 5lipoxygenase (5-LO)-mediated conversion of arachidonic acid to LTs and serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)-mediated de novo synthesis of sphingolipids. Previous studies have shown that endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein ORM1-like protein 3 (ORMDL3) inhibits the activity of SPT and subsequent sphingolipid synthesis. However, the role of ORMDL3 in the synthesis of LTs is not known. In this study, we used peritoneal-derived mast cells isolated from ORMDL3 KO or control mice and examined their calcium mobilization, degranulation, NF-KB inhibitor-alpha phosphorylation, and TNF-alpha production. We found that peritoneal-derived mast cells with ORMDL3 KO exhibited increased responsiveness to antigen. Detailed lipid analysis showed that compared with WT cells, ORMDL3-deficient cells exhibited not only enhanced production of sphingolipids but also of LT signaling mediators LTB4, 6t-LTB4, LTC4, LTB5, and 6t-LTB5. The crosstalk between ORMDL3 and 5-LO metabolic pathways was supported by the finding that endogenous ORMDL3 and 5-LO are localized in similar endoplasmic reticulum domains in human mast cells and that ORMDL3 physically interacts with 5-LO. Further experiments showed that 5-LO also interacts with the long-chain 1 and long chain 2 subunits of SPT. In agreement with these findings, 5-LO knockdown increased ceramide levels, and silencing of SPTLC1 decreased arachidonic acid metabolism to LTs to levels observed upon 5-LO knockdown. These results demonstrate functional crosstalk between the LT and sphingolipid metabolic pathways, leading to the production of lipid signaling mediators.",10608.0,"Bugajev, Viktor:Paulenda, Tomáš:Utekal, Pavol:Mrkáček, Michal:Hálová, Ivana:Kuchař, L.:Kuda, Ondřej:Vávrová, Petra:Schuster, Bjorn:Fuentes-Liso, Sergio:Potůčková, Lucie:Smrž, D.:Černohouzová, Sára:Dráberová, Lubica:Bambousková, Monika:Dráber, Petr",Journal of Lipid Research,3,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Romani in the Czech sociolinguistic space,"The study was prompted by the question of whether Romani, the language of the dominant and traditional minority, is acceptable as a language in the profile of a bilingual living in the Czech Republic. It outlines the situation of Romani in the Czech sociolinguistic space and argues for its rehabilitation so that it could be studied, taught, maintained in a community, and used to represent its speakers. This is necessary in order to raise its prestige, positively affect its speakers’ identity and in turn, stimulate an attitudinal shift and social change. Obstacles to Romani rehabilitation are related to it being framed by Czech culture, which is driven by a standard language ideology rendering Romani a stigmatized language.

LIPSS on thin metallic films: New insights from multiplicity of laser-excited electromagnetic modes and efficiency of metal oxidation,"Thin Cr films 28-nm thick deposited on glass substrates were processed by scanning low-intensity femtosecond laser pulses with energy well below single-pulse damage threshold. Two types of laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) were produced, depending on the scanning velocity, (1) parallel to laser light polarization with periodicity somewhat smaller than laser wavelength and (2) perpendicular to polarization with spatial period much smaller than wavelength. All structures are formed as protrusions above the initial film surface and exhibit a high degree of oxidation. To explain formation of the LIPSS and their conversion from one to another type, a rigorous numerical approach for modeling surface electromagnetic waves in thin-film geometry has been developed, which takes into account the change of optical properties of material due to laser-induced oxidation and porosity.

Biodegradation of PCBs in contaminated water using spent oyster mushroom substrate and a trickle-bed bioreactor,"Due to their persistence, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) represent a group of important environmental pollutants, but conventional physicochemical decontamination techniques for their removal are usually expensive. The main aim of this work was to develop a cost-effective method for PCB bioremediation, focusing on contaminated water and utilizing the well-known degradation capability of Pleurotus ostreatus (the oyster mushroom). For this purpose, the conditions of several laboratory-scale reactors (working volume 1 L) were optimized. Spent oyster mushroom substrate obtained from a commercial farm was used as a fungal inoculum and growth substrate. The highest degradation efficiency (87%) was recorded with a continuous low-flow setup, which was subsequently scaled up (working volume 500 L) and used for the treatment of 4000 L of real contaminated groundwater containing 0.1-1 mu g/L of PCBs. This trickle-bed pilot-scale bioreactor was able to remove 82, 80, 65, and 30-50% of di-, tri-, tetra- and pentachlorinated PCB congeners, respectively. No degradation was observed for hexa- or heptachlorinated congeners. Multiple mono- and dichlorobenzoic acids (CBAs) were identified as transformation products by mass spectrometry, confirming the role of biodegradation in PCB removal. A Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition test revealed slight ecotoxicity of the primary reactor effluent (sampling after 24 h), which was quickly suppressed once the effluent passed through the reactor for the second time. Moreover, no other effluent exhibited toxicity for the rest of the experiment (71 days in total). Microbial analyses (phospholipid fatty acid analysis and next-generation sequencing) showed that P. ostreatus was able to degrade PCBs in the presence of an abundance of other fungal species as well as aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.",20801.0,"Šrédlová, Kamila:Škrob, Zdena:Filipová, Alena:Mašín, P.:Holecová, Jana:Cajthaml, Tomáš",Water Research,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Removal of arsenate and antimonate by acid-treated Fe-rich clays,"Iron impurities in clays degrade the quality in many aspects, but available Fe oxides can significantly improve adsorption affinity of clays to anionic particles. Two natural Fe-rich clays (kaolin and bentonite) were treated in 0.5 M HCl (pH = 1.1) and 0.15 M (COOH)(2) (pH = 1.2), and then used to adsorb As-V/Sb-V oxyanions from model solutions. After acid leaching, the equilibrium sorption capacities (q(max)) increased from 2.3 x 10(-3) to 39.2 x 10(-3) mmol g(-1) for As-V and from 2.4 x 10(-3) to 40.1 x 10(-3) mmol g(-1) for Sb-V, more than doubling the adsorption yields approximate to 95%) of both oxyanions. Leaching in 0.5 M HCl enhanced both As-V and Sb-V adsorption, whereas leaching in 0.15 M (COOH)(2) mainly improved the adsorption of Sb-V. Bentonite, which contained fewer crystalline forms of Fe, exhibited better sorption properties for both oxyanions. The leaching of Fe followed first-order kinetics, whereas the adsorption of As-V/Sb-V followed second-order kinetics.

Greening the hospitality industry: How do green human resource management practices inﬂuence organizational citizenship behavior in hotels?

"Minimal thermal requirements for development and activity of stored product and food industry pests (Acari, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Psocoptera, Diptera and Blattodea): A Review","Low temperatures play an important role in arthropods because they affect both the individual and population development of all physiological and behavioural activities. Manipulation with low temperatures is a primary nonchemical pest control method. For stored product and food industry practitioners, a knowledge of pest thermal requirements, in particular threshold temperatures at which development and other activities of a particular pest species cease, is of crucial importance. This review presents summary data regarding the lower temperature thresholds of 121 species of stored product and food industry pests from six arthropod taxa (Acari, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Psocoptera, Diptera, and Blattodea). In particular, this review collected and summarized information regarding the lower development thresholds, lower population thresholds, lower acoustic or respiratory thresholds, lower walking and flying thresholds and lower trap capture thresholds for flying and walking arthropods. The average lower development threshold (LDT) differed among orders: The lowest was reported for Acari (6.8 °C) and Diptera (8.1 °C), followed by Lepidoptera (11.3 °C) and Psocoptera (13.8 °C), and the highest was reported for Coleoptera (14 °C) and Blattodea (15 °C). An exclusion-function was established showing the percentage of pest species (n = 112) that were developmentally suppressed (excluded) due to temperatures reaching the LDT in the range of decreasing temperatures from 25 °C to 0 °C. We scaled various temperature thresholds from the lowest to highest temperature as follows: The walking threshold, the trap capture threshold for walking insects, the lower development threshold, lower population threshold, lower flying threshold and the lower trap capture threshold for flying pests.

An empirical transcendental hysteresis model for structural systems with pinching and degradation,"The authors present a novel transcendental hysteresis model based on the piecewise definition of arctangent functions. The definition of the shape parameters of the arctangent functions originates from the features of the experimental hysteresis curves directly. In the first step, the authors present this model's application to the experimental cyclic response of cross-laminated timber (CLT), light-timber frame (LTF) shear walls, and a steel angle bracket. Then, the response of a plywood-coupled laminated-veneer lumber (LVL) shear wall is used for validation purposes. The paper introduces the arctangent-based model, labeled Atan model, by illustrating some possible shortcomings of hysteresis models with pinching. The paper concludes with a simple demonstration of these issues in the case of a Bouc-Wen class hysteresis model, the extended energy-dependent generalized Bouc-Wen (eegbw) model. The numerical instabilities of the eegbw model are used to endorse the advantages of the proposed formulation in modeling complex structural arrangements, like wood joints and structural systems. The proposed model originates from the analysis of the experimental response of wood joints.

Who's Afraid of Clicktivism? Exploring Citizens' Use of Social Media and Political Participation in the Czech Republic,"This chapter aims to investigate the connection between online political expression and offline political and civic engagement in the context of the 2013 Czech Parliamentary elections. It is informed by the debates surrounding the role of social network sites in facilitating new forms of civic engagement and political participation. Particularly, we reflect upon the concepts of clicktivism or slacktivism which claim that online activism is often not followed or complemented by offline forms of participation and that there is no link between digital engagement and citizens' real-life actions. This study attempts to test this thesis, using data from a representative survey of the Czech adult population, distributed directly following the 2013 elections. The results suggest that the hypothesis about ""clicktivism"" is all but unfounded in the context of the Czech social network users, as those politically active online during the campaign are more likely to vote and engage more often in other traditional participatory activities as well. The analysis also takes into account other factors such as political interest and political efficacy, with the ambition to provide a more detailed understanding of online political engagement and its relation to offline activities.",0.0,"Mazák, Jaromír:Štětka, Václav",Citizen Participation and Political Communication in a Digital World,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Effect of fiber orientation on tensile behavior of biocomposites prepared from nettle and poly(lactic acid) fibers: Modeling & experiment,"In this work, a micromechanical model of tensile behavior of fibrous composites was formulated by taking into account of the stress-strain behavior of fiber and matrix, the directional arrangement of fibers in the composites, and the relative space occupied by the constituent fibers and matrix in the composites. A simple and easy-to-use expression was obtained for predicting the tensile stress of composites as a function of tensile stresses of fiber and matrix, fiber and matrix volume fractions, and fiber orientation factor. The model was validated with a set of biocomposites prepared by using nettle and poly(lactic acid) fibers and employing compression moudling technology.

Improved demethylation in ecological epigenetic experiments: Testing a simple and harmless foliar demethylation application,"Experimental demethylation of plant DNA enables testing for epigenetic effects in a simple and straightforward way without the use of expensive and laborious DNA sequencing. Plants are commonly demethylated during their germination with the application of agents such as 5-azacytidine (5-azaC). However, this approach can cause unwanted effects such as underdeveloped root systems and high mortality of treated plants, hindering a full comparison with untreated plants, and can be applied only on plant reproducing by seeds. Here we test a simple alternative method of plant demethylation designed to overcome the shortcomings of the germinating method. We compared a novel method of demethylating plants, based on periodical spraying of 5-azaC aqueous solution on established seedlings, with the previous method in which seeds were germinated directly in 5-azaC solution. We quantified the amount of methylated DNA and measured various aspects of plant performance. Also, we demonstrated its applicability in ecological epigenetic experiments by testing transgenerational effects of plant-plant competition. We found that the spray application had similar DNA-demethylating efficiency than the germination method, particularly in the earlier phases of plant development, but without unwanted effects. The spray application method did not reduce plant growth and performance compared to untreated plants, as opposed to the traditional method which showed reduced growth. Also, the spray application method equalized the epigenetically modified plant features of seedlings coming from plants grown under competition and plants growing without competition, demonstrating its application in ecological epigenetic experiments. We conclude that regular spraying of 5-azaC solution onto established seedlings surpassed the germination-in-solution method in terms of vigour and fitness of treated plants. This novel method could thus be better suited for experimental studies seeking valuable insights into ecological epigenetics. Furthermore, the spray method can be suitable for clonal species reproducing asexually, and most importantly, it opens the possibility of community-level experimental demethylation of plants.",10618.0,"Puy, Javier:Dvořáková, Hana:Perez Carmona, Carlos:De Bello, Francesco:Hiiesalu, Inga:Latzel, Vit",Methods in Ecology and Evolution,3,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Enhanced Cooperation in the EU: Its Evolution and Position of the Czech Republic,"Enhanced cooperation (originally closer cooperation) was inserted into the EU institututional and legal system by the Amsterdam Treaty in a response to political calls for establishment of a mechanism that would allow for deeper integration of only some Member States ('coalitions of the willing') in the ever-enlarging EU. As such, this step meant a break with the unity dogma the European integration had been traditionally built upon and provided for institutionalised differentiation in the EU. Redesigned by both the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon, enhanced cooperation has materialized in 5 cases since 2010. Apart from that, possibility of a recourse to enhanced cooperation has played a role in negotiation strategies within the EU decision-making process and in refections on the future of the EU.

Experimental Diagnostics of Entanglement Swapping by a Collective Entanglement Test,"This paper reports on the experimental diagnostics of an entanglement-swapping protocol by means of collective entanglement witness.

More specifically, we demonstrate that our method can distinguish disturbances such as depolarization, phase damping, amplitude damping, and imperfect Bell-state measurement by observing four probabilities and estimating collective entanglement witness.

Genomic imprinting mediates dosage compensation in a young plant XY system,"Sex chromosomes have repeatedly evolved from a pair of autosomes. Consequently, X and Y chromosomes initially have similar gene content, but ongoing Y degeneration leads to reduced expression and eventual loss of Y genes(1). The resulting imbalance in gene expression between Y genes and the rest of the genome is expected to reduce male fitness, especially when protein networks have components from both autosomes and sex chromosomes. A diverse set of dosage compensating mechanisms that alleviates these negative effects has been described in animals(2-4). However, the early steps in the evolution of dosage compensation remain unknown, and dosage compensation is poorly understood in plants(5). Here, we describe a dosage compensation mechanism in the evolutionarily young XY sex determination system of the plant Silene latifolia. Genomic imprinting results in higher expression from the maternal X chromosome in both males and females. This compensates for reduced Y expression in males, but results in X overexpression in females and may be detrimental. It could represent a transient early stage in the evolution of dosage compensation. Our finding has striking resemblance to the first stage proposed by Ohno(6) for the evolution of X inactivation in mammals.",10611.0,"Muyle, A.:Zemp, N.:Fruchard, C.:Čegan, Radim:Vrána, J.:Deschamps, C.:Tavares, R.:Hobza, Roman:Picard, F.:Widmer, A.:Marais, G.A.B.",Nature Plants,3,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The presence of PHB granules in cytoplasm protects non-halophilic bacterial cells against the harmful impact of hypertonic environments,"Numerous prokaryotes accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) intracellularly as a storage material. It has also been proposed that PHB accumulation improves bacterial stress resistance. Cupriavidus necator and its PHB non-accumulating mutant were employed to investigate the protective role of PHB under hypertonic conditions. The presence of PHB granules enhanced survival of the bacteria after exposure to hypertonic conditions. Surprisingly, when coping with such conditions, the bacteria did not utilize PHB to harvest carbon or energy, suggesting that, in the osmotic upshock of C. necator, the protective mechanism of PHB granules is not associated with their hydrolysis. The presence of PHB granules influenced the overall properties of the cells, since challenged PHB-free cells underwent massive plasmolysis accompanied by damage to the cell membrane and the leakage of cytoplasm content, while no such effects were observed in PHB containing bacteria. Moreover, PHB granules demonstrated liquid-like properties indicating that they can partially repair and stabilize cell membranes by plugging small gaps formed during plasmolysis. In addition, the level of dehydration and changes in intracellular pH in osmotically challenged cells were less pronounced for PHB-containing cultures, demonstrating the important role of PHB for bacterial survival under hyperosmotic conditions.",20201.0,"Obruča, S.:Sedláček, P.:Mravec, F.:Krzyžánek, Vladislav:Nebesářová, Jana:Samek, Ota:Kučera, D.:Benešová, P.:Hrubanová, Kamila:Milerová, M.:Márová, I.",New Biotechnology,3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of digital single-operator cholangioscopy (DSOC) on subsequent treatment of patients with biliary stricture. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing DSOC for biliary stricture were enrolled. Gold standard for final diagnosis included histology from surgical resection. In patients without surgery, clinical evaluation methods and repeated imaging studies were used for comparison of DSOC findings and final diagnosis. Patients were followed-up prospectively focusing on subsequent treatment. Results: Among 30 enrolled patients, final diagnosis was malignant in 13 (43%) and benign in 17 (57%). The sensitivity and specificity of visual impression in diagnosing malignant stricture were 100% (95% CI: 75 − 100) and 76% (95% CI: 50 − 93), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for biopsy were 92% (95% CI: 62 − 100) and 100% (95% CI: 78 − 100), respectively. One (3%) case of complicating cholangitis with fatal outcome occurred. Final treatment included surgery in 7 (23%), endoscopy in 18 (60%) and chemotherapy in 3 (10%) of patients. Conclusions: In this study, favorable operating characteristics of DSOC were confirmed.

On the Efficiency of Image Metrics for Evaluating the Visual Quality of 3D Models,"3D meshes are deployed in a wide range of application processes (e.g. transmission, compression, simplification, watermarking and so on) which inevitably introduce geometric distortions that may alter the visual quality of the rendered data. Hence, efficient model-based perceptual metrics, operating on the geometry of the meshes being compared, have been recently introduced to control and predict these visual artifacts. However, since the 3D models are ultimately visualized on 2D screens, it seems legitimate to use images of the models (i.e. snapshots from different viewpoints) to evaluate their visual fidelity. In this work we investigate the use of image metrics to assess the visual quality of 3D models. For this goal, we conduct a wide-ranging study involving several 2D metrics, rendering algorithms, lighting conditions and pooling algorithms, as well as several mean opinion score databases. The collected data allow (1) to determine the best set of parameters to use for this image-based quality assessment approach and (2) to compare this approach to the best performing model-based metrics and determine for which use-case they are respectively adapted.

Relationship Between Dehydrin Accumulation and Winter Survival in Winter Wheat and Barley Grown in the Field,"Low temperatures represent a crucial environmental factor determining winter survival (WS) of barley and wheat winter-type varieties. In laboratory experiments, low temperatures induce an active plant acclimation response, which is associated with an enhanced accumulation of several stress-inducible proteins including dehydrins. Here, dehydrin accumulations in sampled wheat (WCS120 protein family, or WCS120 and WDHN13 transcripts) and barley (DHN5 protein) varieties grown in two locations for two winters were compared with the variety WS evaluated by a provocation wooden-box test. A high correlation between dehydrin transcripts or protein relative accumulation and variety WS score was found only in samples taken prior vernalization fulfillment, when high tolerant varieties accumulated dehydrins earlier and to higher level than less tolerant varieties, and the plants have not yet been vernalized. After vernalization fulfillment, the correlation was weak, and the apical development indicated that plants reached double ridge (DR) in barley or stayed before DR in wheat. Dehydrin proteins and transcripts can be thus used as reliable markers of wheat or barley variety winter hardiness in the field conditions, however, only at the beginning of winter, when the plants have not yet finished vernalization.",40106.0,"Klíma, Miroslav:Prášil, Ilja:Vítámvás, Pavel:Mařík, P.:Kosová, Klára:Holková, L.:Musilová, Jana:Smutná, P.",Frontiers in Plant Science,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
New Opportunities for Forest Remote Sensing Through Ultra-High-Density Drone Lidar,"Current and planned space missions will produce aboveground biomass density data products at varying spatial resolution. Calibration and validation of these data products is critically dependent on the existence of field estimates of aboveground biomass and coincident remote sensing data from airborne or terrestrial lidar. There are few places that meet these requirements, and they are mostly in the northern hemisphere and temperate zone. Here we summarize the potential for low-altitude drones to produce new observations in support of mission science. We describe technical requirements for producing high-quality measurements from autonomous platforms and highlight differences among commercially available laser scanners and drone aircraft. We then describe a case study using a heavy-lift autonomous helicopter in a temperate mountain forest in the southern Czech Republic in support of calibration and validation activities for the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation. Low-altitude flight using drones enables the collection of ultra-high-density point clouds using wider laser scan angles than have been possible from traditional airborne platforms. These measurements can be precise and accurate and can achieve measurement densities of thousands of points m(-2). Analysis of surface elevation measurements on a heterogeneous target observed 51days apart indicates that the realized range accuracy is 2.4cm. The single-date precision is 2.1-4.5cm. These estimates are net of all processing artifacts and geolocation errors under fully autonomous flight.

In this paper we give an overview of recent developments in both instrumentation and methodology at the neutron imaging facilities NEUTRA and ICON at the Paul Scherrer Institut. Increased acquisition rates coupled to new reconstruction techniques improve the information output for fewer projection data, which leads to higher volume acquisition rates. Together, these developments yield significantly higher spatial and temporal resolutions, making it possible to capture finer details in the spatial distribution of the fluid, and to increase the acquisition rate of 3-D CT volumes. The ability to add a second imaging modality, e.g., X-ray tomography, further enhances the feature and process information that can be collected, and these features are ideal for dynamic experiments of fluid distribution in porous media. We demonstrate the performance for a selection of experiments carried out at our neutron imaging instruments.",0.0,"Kaestner, AP:Trtik, P.:Zarebanadkouki, M.:Kazantsev, D.:Sněhota, Michal:Dobson, KJ:Lehmann, EH",Solid Earth,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
When planners depend on powerful actors: Automatism versus intentions,"According to contemporary discourse in planning theory, planners should reveal, criticise and, if possible, influence structures in which power works. But being honest in a case where planners are an integral part of the power structure as employees, contractors or hired consultants might have a harsh personal impact. Is it even possible to challenge the powerful groups on which one depends? This article argues that one of the factors helping planners to do so is &apos,intentions&apos,. Intentions is a supple category with an ambivalent relation to actions. Nevertheless, they belong to the specific preconditions of actions and may imply motives, consistency and responsibility to follow the intended direction. By using the author&apos,s own experience, this article discusses how intentions are formed, how they guide actions, how planning can profit from the time-spatial characteristics of intentions and why intentions strong enough to guide actions belong to factors enabling planners to challenge power. It distinguishes between &apos,automatic planning&apos,, which lacks a wider time-spatial perspective since it is oriented on &apos,here and now&apos, assignments, and &apos,intentions&apos,, which are variable in terms of scale and time, thus, they can guide one&apos,s deliberate actions towards the future. Without intentions that would exceed particular assignments, planning can easily become a routine which, regardless of its professional quality, allows power to work at the edge of arbitrariness.",50601.0,"Dobrucká, Lucia",Planning Theory,3,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Larch Tree Rings as a Tool for Reconstructing 20th Century Central European Atmospheric Mercury Trends,"We propose the tree rings of European Larch (Larix decidua) as a widely available and reliable geochemical archive of local and regional changes in atmospheric mercury (Hg). Mean Hg concentrations in larch tree rings from 8 background sites across the Czech Republic ranged from 2.2 to 4.8 μg kg−1, the maximum concentrations occurred in the period 1951−1970. At 3 sites impacted by Hg-emission sources [gold amalgamation processing, caustic soda production, and lead (Pb) ore smelting] mean larch tree ring Hg concentrations were significantly elevated relative to background sites. Changes in larch tree ring Hg concentrations were temporally coherent with known activities at the sites that would alter Hg emissions, the nearly simultaneous response in tree rings indicated little or no translocation of Hg within the larch bole. Based on the present-day atmospheric Hg concentration of 1.63 ng m−3 at the intensively monitored Czech Global Mercury Observation System site and the most recent mean tree ring Hg concentration of 2.8 μg kg−1 in colocated larch trees, we developed a simple distribution model of Hg between the atmosphere and larch tree rings. We applied the model using observed changes of Hg in larch tree rings from the countrywide background sites to reconstruct past atmospheric Hg concentrations in central Europe. Modeled Hg concentrations were in agreement with annual means from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme observatories.",10511.0,"Navrátil, Tomáš:Nováková, Tereza:Shanley, J.

Exposure to bisphenols and parabenes during pregnancy and relations to steroid changes,"The harmful effects of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) on human health are generally well-known, and exposure during fetal development may have lasting effects. Fetal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been recently relatively well-studied, however, less is known about alternatives such as bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol AF (BPAF), which have started to appear in consumer products. Parabens are another widespread group of EDCs, with confirmed transplacental passage. The usage of many cosmetic, pharmaceutical and consumer products during the pregnancy that may contain parabens and bisphenols has led to the need for investigation. To shed more light into the transplacental transport of BPA, its alternatives, and parabens, and to study their relation to fetal steroidogenesis. BPA, BPS, BPF, BPAF, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, benzylparaben and 15 steroids including estrogens, corticoids, androgens and immunomodulatory ones were determined in 27 maternal (37th week of pregnancy) and cord plasma samples using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry methods. In cord blood, significantly higher BPA levels (p = 0.0455) were observed compared to maternal plasma. The results from multiple regression models showed that in cord blood, methylparaben (beta = -0.027, p = 0.027), propylparaben (beta = -0.025, p = 0.03) and the sum of all measured parabens (beta = -0.037, p = 0.015) were inversely associated with testosterone levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the simultaneous detection of BPA, alternative bisphenols, parabens and steroids in maternal and cord plasma. Our study confirmed the transplacental transport of BPA, with likely accumulation in the fetal compartment. The negative association of cord blood parabens and testosterone levels points to possible risks with respect to importance of testosterone for prenatal male development.",30304.0,"Kolátorová, Lucie:Vítků, Jana:Hampl, Richard:Škodová, Tereza:Šimková, Markéta:Stárka, Luboslav:Dušková, Michaela",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Sporting activities and social stratification in the Czech Republic: a temporal perspective,"Sports have assumed an important role among leisure activities in recent decades. The description of trends in sports participation and their differentiation among social groups are well documented, especially in the context of Western European countries. This paper uses unique datasets obtained from representative surveys of the Czech adult population conducted in 1984, 1991 and 2009 to analyze the relationship between leisure activities and social structure as well as changes to this relationship during the transformation from a socialist to a market economy. Cohort analysis shows significant growth in sports participation throughout the entire observation period, resulting from both generational changes and the general expansion of sports activities within individual cohorts. Furthermore, differentiation in leisure sports participation was strongly determined by social structure, especially as a function of cultural capital. The continuity of this relationship throughout the political and economic changes in Czech society after 1989 suggests that differentiation was associated with cultural distances between social classes, rather than economic or other barriers to sports participation.",0.0,"Špaček, Ondřej",European Journal for Sport and Society,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Diffusive tail anchorage determines velocity and force produced by kinesin-14 between crosslinked microtubules,"Form and function of the mitotic spindle depend on motor proteins that crosslink microtubules and move them relative to each other. Among these are kinesin-14s, such as Ncd, which interact with one microtubule via their non-processive motor domains and with another via their diffusive tail domains, the latter allowing the protein to slip along the microtubule surface. Little is known about the influence of the tail domains on the protein's performance. Here, we show that diffusive anchorage of Ncd's tail domains impacts velocity and force considerably. Tail domain slippage reduced velocities from 270 nm s-1 to 60 nm s-1 and forces from several piconewtons to the sub-piconewton range. These findings challenge the notion that kinesin-14 may act as an antagonizer of other crosslinking motors, such as kinesin-5, during mitosis. It rather suggests a role of kinesin-14 as a flexible element, pliantly sliding and crosslinking microtubules to facilitate remodeling of the mitotic spindle.",10610.0,"Luedecke, A.:Seidel, A.-M.:Braun, Marcus:Lánský, Zdeněk:Diez, S.",Nature Communications,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Very thin thermally stable TiO2 blocking layers with enhanced electron transfer for solar cells,"Very thin TiO2 blocking layers (BLs) are important components for achieving high solar power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in the dye-sensitized solar cells, and particularly perovskite solar cells (PSCs). When reasonably thin, TiO2 BLs prevent recombination of photogenerated charges at the conductive fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate used in these devices. However, all previous attempts to generate efficient TiO2 BLs have been hampered by an insufficient charge transfer rate at quasi-amorphous TiO2 and very low thermal stability, leading to the loss of blocking properties after thermal calcination. In this work, we report the deposition of homogenous very thin (similar to 30 nm) TiO2 BLs by combining advanced high impulse power magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and additional bipolar medium-frequency (MF) magnetron co-sputtering. The as-deposited TiO2 films were shown to provide excellent blocking properties which were preserved even after thermal treatment at 450 degrees C. Moreover, TiO2 BLs thermally treated at 450 degrees C show a well-developed rutile structure and 70 times higher photocurrents compared to the as deposited layers. This work opens possibilities for the utilization of very thin TiO2 layers in solar cell technologies providing a double mode of action: blocking functionality and efficient electron transport.",10405.0,"Kment, Štěpán:Krýsová, Hana:Hubička, Zdeněk:Kmentová, Hana:Kavan, Ladislav:Zbořil, Radek",Applied Materials Today,3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

English correspondences of the particle in three registers of the parallel corpus InterCorp (fiction, journalistic texts and spoken language), however, only confirm its function of an evidential, doubt and uncertainty are not inherent to the meaning of prý but may arise in the context through the process of “invited inference” (see e.g. Traugott and Dasher 2002). The default reporting function is always blocked if the addressee of the reporting event is present in the original interchange, i.e. the information is not new.

Teaching as a part of academics' professionalization: the case of Czech educational sciences,"The article explores the current as well as the future concepts of university teaching by the academics/the “leaders of educational sciences” in the context of the changes of the academia that have affected the academic professionalization. The Delphi method was implemented to answer a research question dealing with the possible change in academics&apos, concept of teaching as part of their current and future work. In this study, the experienced academics in the area of educational science are seen as the “leaders” since through their intensive teaching activities on all three levels (bachelor, master and doctoral) as well as through the high-quality research, they “lead” the concept of a particular science as well as the educational policy. Four rounds were used for consensus building among “leaders” based on a multiple interaction in an anonymous setting.

Continual measurement of arterial dP/dt(max) enables minimally invasive monitoring of left ventricular contractility in patients with acute heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Continuous, reliable evaluation of left ventricular (LV) contractile function in patients with advanced heart failure requiring intensive care remains challenging. Continual monitoring of dP/dtmax from the arterial line has recently become available in hemodynamic monitoring. However, the relationship between arterial dP/dtmax and LV dP/dtmax remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the relationship between arterial dP/dtmax and LV dP/dtmax assessed using echocardiography in patients with acute heart failure. METHODS: Forty-eight patients (mean age 70.4 years [65% male]) with acute heart failure requiring intensive care and hemodynamic monitoring were recruited. Hemodynamic variables, including arterial dP/dtmax, were continually monitored using arterial line pressure waveform analysis. LV dP/dtmax was assessed using continuous-wave Doppler analysis of mitral regurgitation flow. RESULTS: Values from continual arterial dP/dtmax monitoring were significantly correlated with LV dP/dtmax assessed using echocardiography (r = 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.82], P < 0.0001). Linear regression analysis revealed that LV dP/dtmax = 1.25 × (arterial dP/dtmax) (P < 0.0001). Arterial dP/dtmax was also significantly correlated with stroke volume (SV) (r = 0.63, P < 0.0001) and cardiac output (CO) (r = 0.42, P = 0.0289). In contrast, arterial dP/dtmax was not correlated with SV variation, dynamic arterial elastance, heart rate, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), or mean arterial pressure. Markedly stronger agreement between arterial and LV dP/dtmax was observed in subgroups with higher SVR (N = 28, r = 0.91, P <  0.0001), lower CO (N = 26, r = 0.81, P <  0.0001), and lower SV (N = 25, r = 0.60, P = 0.0014). A weak correlation was observed in the subjects with lower SVR (N = 20, r = 0.61, P = 0.0004), in the subgroups with higher CO (N = 22) and higher SV (N = 23), no significant correlation was found. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in patients with acute heart failure requiring intensive care with an arterial line, continuous calculation of arterial dP/dtmax may be used for monitoring LV contractility, especially in those with higher SVR, lower CO, and lower SV, such as in patients experiencing cardiogenic shock. On the other hand, there was only a weak or no significant correlation in the subgroups with higher CO, higher SV, and lower SVR.",30201.0,"Ošťádal, Petr:Vondráková, Dagmar:Krüger, Andreas:Janotka, Marek:Naar, Jan",Critical Care,3,low,medium,1,1,medium,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1

The aim of the ECMO-CS trial is to compare two recognized therapeutic approaches in the management of severe cardiogenic shock: early conservative therapy and early implantation of veno-arterial ECMO on the background of standard care. Methods Eligible patients have either rapidly deteriorating or severe cardiogenic shock, defined using echocardiography, hemodynamic and metabolic criteria. Patients are randomized to the one of two arms: immediate veno-arterial ECMO therapy or early conservative therapy. All other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are performed as per current standard of care, including other cardiovascular interventions (i.e. percutaneous coronary intervention or cardiac surgery). Follow-up includes visits at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months. Primary endpoint is a composite of death from any cause, resuscitated circulatory arrest, and implantation of another mechanical circulatory support device at 30 days. The sample size of 120 individuals (60 in each arm) provides 80% power to detect 50% reduction of primary endpoint, at alpha = 0.05. Patient recruitment started in October 2014. Conclusion The results of the ECMO-CS trial may significantly influence current practice in the management of patients with severe and rapidly deteriorating cardiogenic shock.",30201.0,"Ošťádal, Petr:Rokyta, Richard:Krüger, Andreas:Vondráková, Dagmar:Janotka, Marek:Šmíd, Ondřej:Šmalcová, Jana:Hromádka, Milan:Linhart, Aleš:Bělohlávek, Jan",European Journal of Heart Failure,3,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
VZLUSAT-1: Nanosatellite with miniature lobster eye X-ray telescope and qualification of the radiation shielding composite for space application,"In the upcoming generation of small satellites there is a great potential for testing new sensors, processes and technologies for space and also for the creation of large in situ sensor networks. It plays a significant role in the more detailed examination, modelling and evaluation of the orbital environment. Scientific payloads based on the CubeSat technology are also feasible and the miniature X-ray telescope described in this paper may serve as an example. One of these small satellites from CubeSat family is a Czech CubeSat VZLUSAT-1, which is going to be launched during QB50 mission in 2017. This satellite has dimensions of 100 mm x 100 mm x 230 mm. The VZLUSAT-1 has three main payloads. The tested Radiation Hardened Composites Housing (RHCH) has ambitions to be used as a structural and shielding material to protect electronic devices in space or for constructions of future manned and unmanned spacecraft as well as Moon or Martian habitats. The novel miniaturized X-ray telescope with a Lobster Eye (LE) optics represents an example of CubeSat’s scientific payload. The telescope has a wide field of view and such systems may be essential in detecting the X-ray sources of various physical origin. VZLUSAT-1 also carries the FIPEX payload which measures the molecular and atomic oxygen density among part of the satellite group in QB50 mission. The VZLUSAT-1 is one of the constellation in the QB50 mission that create a measuring network around the Earth and provide multipoint, in-situ measurements of the atmosphere. This paper presents the VZLUSAT-1 satellite including the details about subsystems and payloads. The spacecraft was built between 2011 and 2015. In 2017, our VZLUSAT-1 team has finished the testing phase on a protoflight model and the VZLUSAT-1 is ready to be launched on a circular polar orbit at altitude 500 km ± 20 km.",20304.0,"Urban, Martin:Nentvich, Ondřej:Stehlíková, Veronika:Báča, Tomáš:Dániel, V.:Hudec, René",Acta Astronautica,3,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

We further focus on the emerging role of both genetic and epigenetic aberrations leading to SDH dysfunction associated with various clinical manifestations.

Impact of long-term manure and mineral fertilization on yield and nutritive value of lucerne (Medicago sativa) in relation to changes in canopy structure ,"Fertilization management influences not only productivity but also the nutritive value of forage legumes. However, there have been few studies about these effects in long-term fertilization experiments. Our objectives were: (i) to compare the effects of mineral fertilization and organic manure on lucerne forage yield and leaf and stem nutritive value over a 2-year period following 60 years of different fertilization managements, and (ii) to investigate relationships among canopy structure traits and forage nutritive value in association with these fertilization treatments. The long-term fertilization experiment was established with four replications in the Czech Republic in 1955. Three levels of mineral N, P and K application (0:0:0, 39:24:109 and 91:31:146) were investigated, each with and without farmyard manure, resulting in six treatments. Lucerne stands were estab lished in 2012 and 2013 in two strips. Forage yield was measured in two cuts in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Canopy structure traits and forage nutritive value (crude protein, ash, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and NDF digestibility (NDFD) were analysed in the first cut in each year. Intensive mineral fertilization reduced lucerne nutritive value through a reduction in stem NDFD (-6%) and leaf weight ratio (-10 %) under higher forage productivity (+10 % of annual yield). Manure fertilization improved nutritive value of leaves and stems, with an associated increase in whole plant nutritive value as leaf proportion was maintained with increased yield (+8%). This positive response could be attributed to a soil environment effect: greater root development in soil that had received long-term manure fertilization probably reduced forage lignification and maintained leaf proportion in association with reduced drought stress. Long-term manure fertilization demonstrated potential for improvement of lucerne nutritive value despite the negative relationships between increased plant growth under higher nutrient supply and forage nutritive value.",40106.0,"Mrázková, Marie:Pozdíšek, Jan:Kunzová, Eva:Tocauerová, Štěpánka:Menšík, Ladislav:Hakl, Josef",European Journal of Agronomy,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Human-like telomeres in Zostera marina reveal a mode of transition from the plant to the human telomeric sequences,"A previous study describing the genome of Zostera marina, the most widespread seagrass in the Northern hemisphere, revealed some genomic signatures of adaptation to the aquatic environment such as the loss of stomatal genes, while other functions such as an algal-like cell wall composition were acquired. Beyond these, the genome structure and organization were comparable with those of the majority of plant genomes sequenced, except for one striking feature that went unnoticed at that time: the presence of human-like instead of the expected plant-type telomeric sequences. By using different experimental approaches including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genome skimming by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and analysis of non-coding transcriptome, we have confirmed its telomeric location in the chromosomes of Z. marina. We have also identified its telomerase RNA (TR) subunit, confirming the presence of the human-type telomeric sequence in the template region. Remarkably, this region was found to be very variable even in clades with a highly conserved telomeric sequence across their species. Based on this observation, we propose that alternative annealing preferences in the template borders can explain the transition between the plant and human telomeric sequences. The further identification of paralogues of TR in several plant genomes led us to the hypothesis that plants may retain an increased ability to change their telomeric sequence. We discuss the implications of this occurrence in the evolution of telomeres while introducing a mechanistic model for the transition from the plant to the human telomeric sequences.",10611.0,"Peška, Vratislav:Matl, M.:Mandáková, T.:Vitales, D.:Fajkus, Petr:Fajkus, Jiří:Garcia, S.",Journal of Experimental Botany,3,high,high,1,1,high,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Valorization of spent coffee grounds: A review,"Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) arise as waste products through the production of instant coffee and coffee brewing. This work reviews the composition of SCGs, the methods used for the isolation of individual compounds present in SCGs, the ways of utilizing SCGs presented in the literature so far, including use of SCGs' bioactive compounds, carbohydrates, oil fraction, as well as SCGs as the whole composite without treatment or with some physical and chemical modifications. However, this work mainly focuses on biotechnological processing of SCG hydrolysates and the reason why the fermentable sugars present in SCG hydrolysates cannot support sufficiently the growth of bacteria or yeasts. The reason is basically the presence of toxic co-contaminants, which have antibacterial properties. One suggestion for how to lower the presence of such co-contaminants in SCG hydrolysates is pre-extraction of them or the inclusion of a detoxification step. This review suggests that the fractionation of SCGs and detoxification of SCG hydrolysates might contribute to increased multiple utilization of this waste in many industrial sectors.

Remittances and economic growth: A meta-analysis,"Expatriate workers&apos, remittances represent an important source of financing for low- and middle-income countries. No consensus, however, has yet emerged regarding the effect of remittances on economic growth. In a quantitative survey of 538 estimates reported in 95 studies, we find that approximately 40% of the studies report a positive effect, 40% report no effect, and 20% report a negative effect. Our results indicate publication bias in favor of positive effects. Correcting for the bias using recently developed techniques, we find that the mean effect of remittances on growth is still positive but economically small. Nevertheless, our results uncover noticeable regional differences: remittances are growth-enhancing in Asia but not in Africa. Studies that do not control for alternative sources of external finance, such as foreign aid and foreign direct investment, mismeasure the effect of remittances.

Outcomes of patient self-referral for the diagnosis of several rare inherited kidney diseases,"Purpose: To evaluate self-referral from the Internet for genetic diagnosis of several rare inherited kidney diseases. Methods: Retrospective study from 1996 to 2017 analyzing data from an academic referral center specializing in autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD). Individuals were referred by academic health-care providers (HCPs) nonacademic HCPs, or directly by patients/families. Results: Over 21 years, there were 665 referrals, with 176 (27%) directly from families, 269 (40%) from academic HCPs, and 220 (33%) from nonacademic HCPs. Forty-two (24%) direct family referrals had positive genetic testing versus 73 (27%) families from academic HCPs and 55 (25%) from nonacademic HCPs (P = 0.72). Ninety-nine percent of direct family contacts were white and resided in zip code locations with a mean median income of $77,316 +- 34,014 versus US median income $49,445. Conclusion: Undiagnosed families with Internet access bypassed their physicians and established direct contact with an academic center specializing in inherited kidney disease to achieve a diagnosis. Twenty-five percent of all families diagnosed with ADTKD were the result of direct family referral and would otherwise have been undiagnosed. If patients suspect a rare disorder that is undiagnosed by their physicians, actively pursuing self-diagnosis using the Internet can be successful.

“East meets West” – on studying “Eastern” housing estates through “Western” concepts and approaches,"This paper is directly associated with the international conference “East meets West – contemporary urban issues revisited”. The main objective of the paper is to provide readers with ideas related to the possibility of studying the “Eastern” (post-socialist) housing estates through selected “Western” concepts including representation, symbolism, everydayness/everyday life and the complexity of relations including the materiality or socio-technical configuration of places. The paper consists of three main sections: in the introductory section, basic information and knowledge regarding (large) housing estates are concisely presented and discussed.

Multiple productive IGH rearrangements denote oligoclonality even in immunophenotypically monoclonal CLL,"In our systematic study of CLL cases with multiple productive IGH rearrangements (MP-IGH CLL),3 we previously showed that one-third of them exhibit two CLL populations with distinct immunophenotypes. We also pointed to the presence of multiple clones as a likely cause of MP-IGH detection even in cases with an immunophenotypically monoclonal disease, on the basis of IGK, IGL and incomplete IGH gene rearrangement analyses. Still, the underlying biological cause of MP-IGHs possibly involves lack of allelic exclusion4 or IGHV gene replacement.5 The extent to which these mechanisms are involved in MP-IGH CLL cases with homogeneous immunophenotype is still not known, and the lack of conclusive evidence hinders further research on CLL oligoclonality. To clarify this phenomenon, we performed extensive analysis of clonality in MP-IGH CLL combining conventional methods (Sanger sequencing, IGH fragment analysis), immunophenotyping, single-cell analysis (SCA), and next-generation sequencing (NGS).",30204.0,"Brázdilová, Kamila:Plevová, Karla:Skuhrová Francová, Hana:Kockova, H.:Borský, Marek:Bikos, V.:Malčíková, Jitka:Oltová, Alexandra:Kotašková, Jana:Tichy, B.:Brychtová, Yvona:Mayer, Jiří:Doubek, Michael:Pospíšilová, Šárka",Leukemia,3,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Deep Intronic Mutation in SERPING1 Caused Hereditary Angioedema Through Pseudoexon Activation,"Purpose Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant life-threatening disease characterized by low levels of C1 inhibitor (type I HAE) or normal levels of ineffective C1 inhibitor (type II HAE), typically occurring as a consequence of a SERPING1 mutation. In some cases, a causal mutation remains undetected after using a standard molecular genetic analysis. Results Here we show a long methodological way to the final discovery of c.1029 + 384A &gt, G, a novel deep intronic mutation in intron 6 which is responsible for HAE type I in a large family and has not been identified by a conventional diagnostic approach. This mutation results in de novo donor splice site creation and subsequent pseudoexon inclusion, the mechanism firstly described to occur in SERPING1 in this study. We additionally discovered that the proximal part of intron 6 is a region potentially prone to pseudoexon-activating mutations, since natural alternative exons and additional cryptic sites occur therein. Indeed, we confirmed the existence of at least two different alternative exons in this region not described previously. Conclusions In conclusion, our results suggest that detecting aberrant transcripts, which are often low abundant because of nonsense-mediated decay, requires a modified methodological approach.

Proton-Gradient-Driven Oriented Motion of Nanodiamonds Grafted to Graphene by Dynamic Covalent Bonds,"Manipulating nanoscopic objects by external stimuli is the cornerstone of nanoscience. Here, we report the implementation of dynamic covalent chemistry in the reversible binding and directional motion of fluorescent nanodiamond particles at a functionalized graphene surface via imine linkages. The dynamic connections allow for controlling the formation and rupture of these linkages by external stimuli. By introduction of pH gradients, the nanoparticles are driven to move along the gradient due to the different rates of the imine condensation and hydrolysis in the two environments. The multivalent nature of the particle-to-surface connection ensures that particles remain attached to the surface, whereas its dynamic character allows for exchange reaction, thus leading to displacement yet bound behavior in two-dimensional space.

Evolution of Advanced Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia Unveiled by Single-Cell Transcriptomics: A Case Report,"Genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity of Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) limits prevention of disease progression.

Hopes of Derrida’s Reading? On Emergence of Peirce’s Texts in the Poststructuralist Context,"The chapter focuses on the problem of divergent (and eventually misleading) interpretations of Ch. S. Peirce’s texts presented by leading philosophical figures of the ‘70 and the ’80, such as Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Umberto Eco. The poststructuralist re-discovery of Peirce’s semiotics seemed to be a possible “cure” for the totalitarian “disease” of structuralism. Trying to find a way out of “dying” structuralism, the poststructuralists upraised Peirce to one of the main sources of their philosophical inspiration. Thanks to them, Peirce became an attractive, frequent and influential reading for various contemporary semioticians of photographic image, like Rosalind Krauss, Thierry de Duve, Henri Van Lier or Jean-Marie Schaeffer. According to the author’s claim, this situation gave birth to various poststructuralist interpretations that made up Peirce’s texts in order to fit it in poststructuralist context of thinking. On the example of Derrida’s reading of Peirce, the paper analysis poststructuralist intentions, expectations and hopes that shaped these interpretations. Finally, the author points out several distinctions between Peirce’s semiotics and semiotics of poststructuralism (that should be seen as eventual reasons for poststructuralist disappointment by Peirce’s metaphysics).",60301.0,"Fišerová, Michaela",How to Make Our Signs Clear: C.

Oral bioaccessibility of metal(loid)s in dust materials from mining areas of northern Namibia,"Ore mining and processing in semi-arid areas is responsible for the generation of metalloid containing dust, which is easily transported by wind to the surrounding environment. To assess the human exposure to dustderived metalloids As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb, Zn, as well as the potential risks related to incidental dust ingestion, we studied mine tailing dust , slag dust  and smelter dust from old mining and smelting sites in northern Namibia Kombat, Berg Aukas, Tsumeb. In vitro bioaccessibility testing using extraction in simulated gastric fluid SGF was combined with determination of grain size distributions, chemical and mineralogical characterizations and leaching tests conducted on original dust samples and separated PM10 fractions.  Extremely high As and Pb bioaccessibilities in the smelter dusts were caused by the presence of highly soluble phases such as arsenolite and various metal arsenates unstable under the acidic conditions of SGF.

Energy Comparison of Controllers Used for a Differential Drive Wheeled Mobile Robot,"In order to select the best controller for a Differential Drive Wheeled Mobile Robot (DDWMR), an energy consumption comparison relating to tracking accuracy is used as a very strict criterion. Therefore, this paper reviews some well-known controllers designed for the DDWMR. Furthermore, there are presented several experiments with the extensible open-source code programmed in Python. Such an extensible open-source code presentation could serve as a tool for simulating, comparing, and evaluating a set of different control algorithms. The kinematic and dynamic models of the DDWMR and control algorithms are implemented in this open-source code to determine a travel time, a distance between the robot’s position and a given path, a linear velocity, an angular velocity, a travel path length, and a total kinetic energy loss of the DDWMR. These simulation results are used to compare and evaluate the given control algorithms. Moreover, the simulation results also enable to answer the question of whether a significant increase in energy consumption is worth shortening the travel path by just a bit. Finally, this paper includes a direct link to the stored experiments which are runnable and could serve as a proof.

Identity Development Among Youth of Vietnamese Descent in Czech Republic,"Adolescence is a turbulent time during which many young people reflect on their identities. Identity development is particularly challenging for immigrant children and children of immigrants. This chapter focuses on the dynamics of identity development and the construction of a sense of self among youth of Vietnamese origin in the Czech Republic. Based on field research, the chapter shows how these young people contest an identity for themselves while trying to come to terms with both the traditional Vietnamese culture of their parents and the way of life of the majority society that affected their socialization processes. The goal of this research was to focus on the dynamics of the processes involved in identity development rather than ascertain whether the children label themselves as Vietnamese or Czech, or something in between (""identity outcomes"").

Open government partnership: unutilized potential in post-communist EU members? (Case of the Czech Republic),"This provided paper is a part of the research on transparent lobbying: “Impact of Transparency of Lobbying on Democratization and Its Consequences”. In this paper, I have shown that open government data might mean transparency about government if the effort will focus rather on political objectives not technological ones and rather on motivations not stimulations. It is among other things important to transparent lobbying as part of a broader approach to governance, based on the principles of openness, transparency, participation and disclosure. The problem of lack of transparent lobbying is closely related to increased inequality of access by voices representative of a wide range of interests to public decision-making.  The Open Government Partnership (OGP), based on open government data, focuses on these issues and aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. I have reported that the Czech Republic does not use the potential of OGP enough.  The qualitative analysis includes relevant sources on this issue, and both national and international comparative studies on open government data and open government partnership. For the case study of the Czech Republic, I analyse a starting position in the given areas and independent progress reports.

Chicken feather and wheat straw hydrolysate for direct utilization in biobutanol production,"Lignocellulosic material possesses a source of fermentable saccharides for biofuel production, however it must be supplemented with other nutrients for microbial growth. We have investigated the use of chicken feather as a source of amino acids and peptides. Alkaline hydrolysis of feather under mild conditions (80 °C, 0.6% NaOH) provided a highly solubilized preparation of assimilable nitrogen. Similar conditions were applicable for pre-treatment of wheat straw. The concentration of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors was low so washing or detoxification steps were unnecessary. Therefore, hydrolysis of both materials was carried out simultaneously, resulting in a cultivation medium that was suitable for direct use in biobutanol production. Thirteen strains of solventogenic clostridia were tested for their ability to produce butanol on this mixed hydrolysate, strains of Clostridium beijerinckii and Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum produced the highest butanol concentrations. The proposed process of simultaneous hydrolysis followed by direct inoculation was then demonstrated by experimental production of butanol in a laboratory bioreactor, using C. beijerinckii strain NCIMB 8052 and producing 4.6 g/L of butanol. Although process optimization is still required, we have shown that feather and wheat straw could be co-processed, forming a convenient mixed substrate for biobutanol production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20903.0,"Branská, Barbora:Fořtová, Lenka:Dvořáková, Monika:Liu, H.:Patáková, Petra:Zhang, J.:Melzoch, Karel",RENEWABLE ENERGY,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cost-effectiveness of care for people with psychosis in the community and psychiatric hospitals in the Czech Republic: an economic analysis,"Background: The absence of economic evidence hinders current reforms of hospital-based mental health systems in central and eastern Europe. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of discharge to community care for people with chronic psychoses compared with care in psychiatric hospitals in the Czech Republic. Methods: We did a prospective study of people aged 18–64 years with chronic psychotic disorders in the Czech Republic who had been discharged into community services or were receiving inpatient psychiatric care for at least 3 months at baseline. We measured health-related quality of life with the EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire. Adjusting for baseline differences between the two groups, we assessed differences in societal costs in 2016 and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) during a 12-month follow-up, which we then used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We did multiple sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our results. Findings: In our baseline case scenario, we included 115 patients who were either community service users (n=35) or inpatients (n=80) at baseline. The two groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics. The annual QALY was 0·77 in patients receiving community care at baseline compared with 0·80 in patients in hospital at baseline (difference 0·03, 95% CI −0·04 to 0·10), but the costs of discharge to the community were €8503 compared with €16 425 for no discharge (difference €7922, 95% CI 4497–11 346), such that the ICER reached more than €250 000 per QALY. This ICER is substantially higher than levels that are conventionally considered to be cost-effective and the estimated probability that discharge to the community was cost-effective was very high (≥97%). None of the sensitivity analyses changed these results qualitatively. Interpretation: This study provides economic evidence for deinstitutionalisation by showing that discharge to community care is cost-effective compared with care in psychiatric hospitals in the Czech Republic. These findings add to the human rights and clinical-based arguments for mental health-care reforms in central and eastern Europe.

Scaling of the MHD perturbation amplitude required to trigger a disruption and predictions for ITER,"The amplitude of locked instabilities, likely magnetic islands, seen as precursors to disruptions has been studied using data from the JET, ASDEX Upgrade and COMPASS tokamaks. It was found that the thermal quench, that often initiates the disruption, is triggered when the amplitude has reached a distinct level. This information can be used to determine thresholds for simple disruption prediction schemes. The measured amplitude in part depends on the distance of the perturbation to the measurement coils. Hence the threshold for the measured amplitude depends on the mode location (i.e. the rational q-surface) and thus indirectly on parameters such as the edge safety factor, q(95), and the internal inductance, li(3), that determine the shape of the q-profile. These dependencies can be used to set the disruption thresholds more precisely. For the ITER baseline scenario, with typically q(95) = 3.2, li(3) = 0.9 and taking into account the position of the measurement coils on ITER, the maximum allowable measured locked mode amplitude normalized to engineering parameters was estimated to be a.B-ML(r(c))/I-p = 0.92 m mT/MA, or directly as a fraction edge poloidal magnetic field: BML(r(c))/B theta(a) = 5 . 10(-3). But these values decrease for operation at higher q(95) or lower li(3). The analysis found furthermore that the above empirical criterion to trigger a thermal quench is more consistent with a criterion derived with the concept of a critical island size, i.e. the thermal quench seemed to be triggered at a distinct island width.",0.0,"de Vries, P.C.:Pautasso, G.:Nardon, E.:Cahyna, Pavel:Gerasimov, S.:Havlíček, Josef:Hender, T.C.:Huijsmans, G.T.A.:Lehnen, M.:Maraschek, M.:Markovič, Tomáš:Snipes, J.A.",Nuclear Fusion,3,medium,high,0,0,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Who Do Parrots Talk To? Agreeableness and a Serious Approach Increase the Production of Word-like Utterances by African Grey Parrots,"Label acquisition projects with the grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) demonstrated cognitive and communicative skills of this species comparable to great apes. However, results differ profoundly between individuals and laboratories. Two studies investigated the relationship between the characteristics, behaviors and attitudes of human trainers and caregivers, and the word-like sound production of grey parrots. In Study 1, 78 student subjects, who had trained two parrots for five years in our laboratory with the model/rival technique (used to teach animals to use vocal labels in a symbolic way), filled out the personality questionnaire NEO-Five Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992) and answered additional questions about motivation, approach to animals etc. Parrots' communication during sessions with individual trainers was associated with higher agreeableness, a more serious approach to training, and a shorter period of time serving as a trainer. In Study 2, 29 pet owners and their respective parrots were tested using analogous questions used in Study 1. Results confirmed the effect of agreeableness and a serious approach to training on the production of human words uttered by parrots. In addition, pet owners with higher interest in bird communication had parrots that produced more words. Both studies indicate that the success of communication projects with grey parrots or other species might have been influenced by the characteristics of trainers/caregivers and their relationships with the trained animals.",0.0,"Lindová, Jitka",Human-Animal Interaction Bulletin,3,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Photocurrent Spectroscopy of Perovskite Layers and Solar Cells: A Sensitive Probe of Material Degradation,"Optical absorptance spectroscopy of polycrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 films usually indicates the presence of a PbI2 phase, either as a preparation residue or due to film degradation, but gives no insight on how this may affect electrical properties. Here, we apply photocurrent spectroscopy to both perovskite solar cells and coplanar-contacted layers at various stages of degradation. In both cases, we find that the presence of a PbI2 phase restricts charge-carrier transport, suggesting that PbI2 encapsulates CH3NH3PbI3 grains.

Development of electrocardiographic sex differences during puberty,"This chapter summarizes knowledge about the sex differences of electrocardiogram (ECG) in children and adolescents. The most important part is cardiac repolarization expressed as QT interval on surface QCG. It is well known, that QT interval duration is the same in both sexes in preadolescent children. The QT interval changes during adolescence and finally is longer in females. Until recently only resting QT interval was analysed in few studies in childhood. In this chapter we are presenting investigation of children and adolescents using continuous ECG recordings during postural provocation to obtain individual-specific QT/RR profiles over broad heart rate ranges. We observed QTc prolongation of 0,7 ms per year in females on the contrary to shortening of 0,64 s per year in males. The analyses suggest that hormonal changes are likely causing QTc shortening in adolescent males but are unlikely the principal cause of QTc prolongation in females.",30201.0,"Andršová, Irena:Hnatkova, K.:Helánová, Kateřina:Novotný, Tomáš",Sex and Cardiac Electrophysiology: Differences in Cardiac Electrical Disorders Between Men and Women,3,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Verb errors in advanced learner English,"The study explores the spoken language of advanced English speakers with regard to the mistakes and inaccuracies they make in the use of morphological categories of verbs. The data is drawn from the advanced learner corpus LINDSEI_CZ (50 advanced students). The results are quantitatively analysed in order to identify phenomena in which advanced students commit errors most frequently. Such errors occur even in relatively basic usage of tenses and sequence of tenses, especially in the present perfect. The study also identifies a number of other typical problems and points out that these problems may stem from negative L1 transfer, but may also be due to inappropriate techniques used in teaching these phenomena. It calls for the reassessment of grammar teaching, away from the decontextualized practice and grammatical interpretation based on strict rules, and towards a discourse-oriented practice and the development of a deeper understanding of complex concepts that influence the choice of tense and aspect.",60203.0,"Gráf, Tomáš",Acta Universitatis Carolinae.

Transformation of the identity of homeless women with an experience of domestic violence: changing from a victim to a survivor: an example from shelters for mothers in the Czech Republic,"Transformation of victim´s identity into a survivor´s identity in mothers living in a shelter in Czech Republic. Domestic violence and commonly associated homelessness can be a very traumatic experience affecting the identity of homeless mothers. To understand victimological concept of reframing a victim into a survivor, we used analysis of data collected in qualitative participative research with 33 single mothers living with their children in shelters. The data shows that changing a victim´s identity to a survivor´s identity is realised in four stages that include: (1) the narratives of silence, (2) the narratives of total silence, (3) the narratives of transformation, and (4) the narratives of self-transcendence. An important element in the process of identity transformation is the relationship with the social worker.

Simon Thadeas Budek and his Contacts at the Court of Rudolf II,"It was characteristic feature of alchemists around Rudolf II that they were recruited from diverse strata of society. Another one of the somewhat mysterious figures was Protestant priest, alchemist, and searcher for precious stones Šimon Tadeáš Budek of Lešín and Falkenberk (? - after 1608). The best source we have about Budek is his own manuscript on alchemy, dating to around 1604-1608 The Manuscript ""Varii tractatus chemici"" gives us a look inside the discipline of natural science as it flourished around the turn of the 17th century and attracted the interest of every rank of society. For us, his author is a model case by which we can see the kind of relationships that developed among the members of the remarkable intellectual circles around Rudolf II. For his work Budek needed not only material support, but social backing as well. Thus he buttressed his conclusions by listing the names of figures who were not only ""scientific"" authorities, but also people who could provide the necessary social references, and through whom he obtained the sought-after material assistance without which his work could not have continued.",0.0,"Hausenblasová, Jaroslava:Purš, Ivo",Alchemy and Rudolf II.

To this end, 1047 (49.2% female) 7th and 8th graders completed questionnaires on their face-to-face bullying, cyberbullying, callous-unemotional traits, and online disinhibition. The findings revealed that increases in uncaring were more associated with self-reported non-anonymous and anonymous cyberbullying at higher levels of online disinhibition. The findings are discussed in the context of the characteristics associated with callous-unemotional traits, and how these characteristics increase adolescents' risk of cyberbullying perpetration.

On the long-term impact of emissions from central European cities on regional air quality,"The impact of urban emission from Central European cities on the present-day regional air quality is examined using the regional climate model RegCM4.2 coupled with the chemistry transport model CAMx, including two-way interactions. Simulations was carried out for the 2001-2010 period either with all urban emissions included (base case) or without considering urban emissions. Further, the sensitivity of ozone production to urban emissions was examined by performing reduction experiments with -20% emission perturbation of NOx and/or non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). The modeling system's air quality related outputs were evaluated using AirBase, and EMEP surface measurements. European air quality measures were chosen as metrics describing the cities emission impact on regional air pollution. Due to urban emissions, significant ozone titration occurs over cities while over rural areas remote from cities, ozone production is modeled, mainly in terms of number of exceedances and accumulated exceedances. Urban NOx, SO2 and PM2.5 emissions also significantly contribute to concentrations in the cities themselves (up to 50-70% for NOx and SO2, and up to 60% for PM2.5), but the contribution is large over rural areas as well (10-20 %). Although air pollution over cities is largely determined by the local urban emissions, considerable (often a few tens of %) fraction of the concentration is attributable to other sources from rural areas and minor cities. It is shown that to achieve significant ozone reduction over cities in central Europe, the emission control strategies have to focus on the reduction of NMVOC, as reducing NOx (due to suppressed titration) often leads to increased O-3. The influence over rural areas is however always in favor of improved air quality, i.e. both NOx and/or NMVOC reduction ends up in decreased ozone pollution, mainly in terms of exceedances.",0.0,"Huszár, Peter:Belda, Michal:Halenka, Tomáš",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,3,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Coming of age in the Czech countryside: Life and educational transition contexts for rural youth,"The chapter focuses on rural youth, their aspirations and attitudes toward education in the context of regional differentiation of living and educational conditions in Czech rural areas. Although Czechia is not a large country with extremely heterogeneous living conditions within its particular regions, the consequences of political, economic and societal transformations have not been identical everywhere. On the example of Czechia, we would like to document variability of rural space considering diversity of local and regional factors influencing accessibility of compulsory education and students&apos, aspirations. First, we will describe the character of external environment of provision of education on the basis of classification of rural space in Czechia utilizing quantitative socioeconomic indicators commonly used in current regionalizations. We will analyze the spatial patterns in characteristics of rural elementary schools and in provision of education. We will explain factors leading to regional differentiation of rural space with special stress on contrasting conditions in inland and borderland areas and on tensions between cores and peripheries. The specific geographical position and differences in past development of borderland and inland define many aspects of functioning of local communities up to present days. Second, we will describe Czech post-compulsory education system to present the institutional conditions setting the environment for student&apos,s aspirations and decision-making. Generally, Czech school system is characterized by tracking pupils at rather early age and it has relatively high share of upper secondary students in technical/professional and vocational study tracks. Third, we will analyze disparities in aspirations of pupils ending compulsory education, their perceptions of spatial mobility and school choice in two different examples of rural areas. One studied locality is located in a peripheral rural area in the Czech borderland and the second locality is located in Central Bohemia in the wider region around the capital city of Prague.",50301.0,"Dvořák, Dominik:Kučerová, Silvie Rita:Simonová, Jaroslava:Meyer, Petr:Kučera, Zdeněk:Šmíd, Jan",Rural Youth at the Crossroads: Transitional Societies in Central Europe and Beyond,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Controlled reactive HiPIMS - effective technique for low-temperature (300 °C) synthesis of VO2 films with semiconductor-to-metal transition,Reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) with a pulsed O2 flow control and to-substrate O2 injection into a high-density plasma in front of the sputtered vanadium target was used for low-temperature (300 °C) deposition of VO2 films with a pronounced semiconductor-to-metal transition onto conventional soda-lime glass substrates without any substrate bias voltage and without any interlayer. The deposition-averaged target power density was close to 13 W/cm^2 at a fixed duty cycle of 1% with a peak target power density up to 5 kW/cm^2 during voltage pulses ranged from 40 µs to 100 µs. A high modulation of the transmittance at 2500 nm (between 51% and 8% at the film thickness of 88 nm) and the electrical resistivity (changed 350 times) at the transition temperature of 56–57 °C was achieved for the VO2 films synthesized using 50 µs voltage pulses when the crystallization of the thermochromic VO2(M1) phase was supported by the high-energy (up to 50 eV relative to ground potential) ions.,20506.0,"Vlček, Jaroslav:Kolenatý, David:Houška, Jiří:Kozák, Tomáš:Čerstvý, Radomír",JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS,3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Overview of the current status of familial hypercholesterolaemia care in over 60 countries - The EAS Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Studies Collaboration (FHSC),"Background and aims: Management of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) may vary across different settings due to factors related to population characteristics, practice, resources and/or policies. We conducted a survey among the worldwide network of EAS FHSC Lead Investigators to provide an overview of FH status in different countries. Methods: Lead Investigators from countries formally involved in the EAS FHSC by mid-May 2018 were invited to provide a brief report on FH status in their countries,including available   information, programmes, initiatives, and management. Results: 63 countries provided reports. Data on FH prevalence are lacking in most countries. Where available, data tend to align with recent estimates, suggesting a higher frequency than that traditionally considered. Low rates of FH detection are reported across all regions. National registries and education programmes to improve FH awareness/knowledge are a recognised priority, but funding is often lacking. In most countries, diagnosis primarily relieson the Dutch Lipid Clinics Network criteria. Although available in many countries, genetic testing is not widely implemented (frequent cost issues). There are only a few national official government programmes for FH. Under-treatment is anissue. FH therapy is not universally reimbursed. PCSK9-inhibitors are available in ∼2/3 countries. Lipoprotein-apheresis is offered in ∼60% countries, although access is limited. Conclusions: FH is a recognised public health concern. Management varies widely across countries, with over all suboptimal identification and under-treatment. Efforts and initiatives to improve FH knowledge and management  are underway, including development of national registries, but support, particularly from health authorities, and better funding are greatly needed",30201.0,"Vallejo-Vaz, Antonio J.:De Marco, Martina:Stevens, Christophe A.

However, the possibility of the recognition of liability for legislative harm also seems now to be developing, on the basis of rulings of the Constitutional Code in 2011.

Proteomic analysis of Rickettsia akari proposes a 44 kDa-OMP as a potential biomarker for Rickettsialpox diagnosis,"Background: Rickettsialpox is a febrile illness caused by the mite-borne pathogen Rickettsia akari. Several cases of this disease are reported worldwide annually. Nevertheless, the relationship between the immunogenicity of R. akari and disease development is still poorly understood. Thus, misdiagnosis is frequent. Our study is aiming to identify immunogenic proteins that may improve disease recognition and enhance subsequent treatment. To achieve this goal, two proteomics methodologies were applied, followed by immunoblot confirmation. Results: Three hundred and sixteen unique proteins were identified in the whole-cell extract of R. akari. The most represented protein groups were found to be those involved in translation, post-translational modifications, energy production, and cell wall development. A significant number of proteins belonged to amino acid transport and intracellular trafficking. Also, some proteins affecting the virulence were detected. In silico analysis of membrane enriched proteins revealed 25 putative outer membrane proteins containing beta-barrel structure and 11 proteins having a secretion signal peptide sequence. Using rabbit and human sera, various immunoreactive proteins were identified from which the 44 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GP63) has demonstrated a unique detection capability. It positively distinguished the sera of patients with Rickettsialpox from other rickettsiae positive human sera. Conclusion: Our proteomic analysis certainly contributed to the lack of knowledge of R. akari pathogenesis. The result obtained may also serve as a guideline for a more accurate diagnosis of rickettsial diseases. The identified 44 kDa uncharacterized protein can be certainly used as a unique marker of rickettsialpox or as a target molecule for the development of more effective treatment.",10606.0,"Dresler, Jiří:Pajer, Petr",BMC Microbiology,3,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sustained Inflammatory Signalling through Stat1/Stat2/IRF9 Is Associated with Amoeboid Phenotype of Melanoma Cells,"The invasive behaviour of cancer cells underlies metastatic dissemination, however, due to the large plasticity of invasion modes, it is challenging to target. It is now widely accepted that various secreted cytokines modulate the tumour microenvironment and pro-inflammatory signalling can promote tumour progression. Here, we report that cells after mesenchymal-amoeboid transition show the increased expression of genes associated with the type I interferon response. Moreover, the sustained activation of type I interferon signalling in response to IFNβ mediated by the Stat1/Stat2/IRF9 complex enhances the round amoeboid phenotype in melanoma cells, whereas its downregulation by various approaches promotes the mesenchymal invasive phenotype. Overall, we demonstrate that interferon signalling is associated with the amoeboid phenotype of cancer cells and suggest a novel role of IFNβ in promoting cancer invasion plasticity, aside from its known role as a tumour suppressor.",10601.0,"Gandalovičová, Aneta:Šůchová, Anna-Marie:Čermák, Vladimír:Merta, Ladislav:Rösel, Daniel:Brábek, Jan",Cancers,3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Computational Design of Stable and Soluble Biocatalysts,"Natural enzymes are delicate biomolecules possessing only marginal thermodynamic stability. Poorly stable, misfolded, and aggregated proteins lead to huge economic losses in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries. Consequently, there is a need to design optimized protein sequences that maximize stability, solubility, and activity over a wide range of temperatures and pH values in buffers of different composition and in the presence of organic cosolvents. This has created great interest in using computational methods to enhance biocatalysts&apos, robustness and solubility. Suitable methods include (i) energy calculations, (ii) machine learning, (iii) phylogenetic analyses, and (iv) combinations of these approaches. We have witnessed impressive progress in the design of stable enzymes over the last two decades, but predictions of protein solubility and expressibility are scarce. Stabilizing mutations can be predicted accurately using available force fields, and the number of sequences available for phylogenetic analyses is growing. In addition, complex computational workflows are being implemented in intuitive web tools, enhancing the quality of protein stability predictions. Conversely, solubility predictors are limited by the lack of robust and balanced experimental data, an inadequate understanding of fundamental principles of protein aggregation, and a dearth of structural information on folding intermediates. Here we summarize recent progress in the development of computational tools for predicting protein stability and solubility, critically assess their strengths and weaknesses, and identify apparent gaps in data and knowledge. We also present perspectives on the computational design of stable and soluble biocatalysts.",10403.0,"Musil, Miloš:Konegger, Hannes:Hon, Jiří:Bednář, David:Damborský, Jiří",ACS Catalysis,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Orthorhombic intermediate phase originating from {110} nanotwinning in Ni50.0Mn28.7Ga21.3 modulated martensite,"The temperature evolution of the structure of Ni50.0Mn28.7Ga21.3, single crystals exhibiting magnetic shape memory effect was investigated near the martensitic transformation by X-ray diffraction. Upon heating, five-layered modulated monoclinic martensite (10M) with a = 0.5974 nm, b = 0.5949 nm, c = 0.5589 nm, and 7 = 90.34 at room temperature (297 K) changed to an intermediate (10M') phase with a = b = 0.5945 nm, c = 0.5616 nm, and gamma = 90.25 degrees at a few tenths of kelvin below the transformation to austenite at T-A = 327 K. This previously unreported 10M' phase between 10M martensite and austenite can be described as orthorhombic using axes diagonal to the original a and b axes derived from the cubic L2(1) cell.

Pair housing makes calves more optimistic,"Individual housing of dairy calves is common farm practice, but has negative effects on calf welfare. A compromise between practice and welfare may be housing calves in pairs. We compared learning performances and affective states as assessed in a judgement bias task of individually housed and pair-housed calves. Twenty-two calves from each housing treatment were trained on a spatial Go/No-go task with active trial initiation to discriminate between the location of a teat-bucket signalling either reward (positive location) or non-reward (negative location). We compared the number of trials to learn the operant task (OT) for the trial initiation and to finish the subsequent discrimination task (DT). Ten pair-housed and ten individually housed calves were then tested for their responses to ambiguous stimuli positioned in-between the positive and negative locations. Housing did not affect learning speed (OT: F1,34 = 0.42, P = 0.52, DT: F1,34 = 0.25, P = 0.62), but pair-housed calves responded more positively to ambiguous cues than individually housed calves (χ21 = 6.76, P = 0.009), indicating more positive affective states.

High Resolution Air Quality Forecasting over Prague within the URBI PRAGENSI Project: Model Performance during the Winter Period and the Effect of Urban Parameterization on PM,"The overall impact of urban environments on the atmosphere is the result of many different nonlinear processes, and their reproduction requires complex modeling approaches. The parameterization of these processes in the models can have large impacts on the model outputs. In this study, the evaluation of a WRF/Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) forecast modeling system set up for Prague, the Czech Republic, within the project URBI PRAGENSI is presented. To assess the impacts of urban parameterization in WRF, in this case with the BEP+BEM (Building Environment Parameterization linked to Building Energy Model) urban canopy scheme, on Particulate Matter (PM) simulations, a simulation was performed for a winter pollution episode and compared to a non-urbanized run with BULK treatment. The urbanized scheme led to an average increase in temperature at 2 m by 2 ∘ C, a decrease in wind speed by 0.5 m s −1 , a decrease in relative humidity by 5%, and an increase in planetary boundary layer height by 100 m. Based on the evaluation against observations, the overall model error was reduced. These impacts were propagated to the modeled PM concentrations, reducing them on average by 15–30 μ g m −3 and 10–15 μ g m −3 for PM 10 and PM 2.5 , respectively. In general, the urban parameterization led to a larger underestimation of the PM values, but yielded a better representation of the diurnal variations.",10509.0,"Ďoubalová, Jana:Huszár, Peter:Benešová, Nina:Belda, Michal:Vlček, Ondřej:Karlický, Jan:Geletič, Jan:Halenka, Tomáš:Eben, Kryštof",Atmosphere,3,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Body mass estimation in skeletal samples using the hybrid approach : the effect of population-specific variations and sexual dimorphism,"Body mass is estimated from skeletal records with low accuracy, and it is expected that population-specific equations derived by a hybrid approach may help to reduce the error in body mass estimates. We used 204 individuals from five Central European Early Medieval sites to test the effect of population-specific femoral head breadth equations on the accuracy of body mass estimates. The baseline for living body mass was computed using the biiliac breadth and stature. We also analyzed the agreement of five general femoral head techniques that are used in body mass estimation (Elliott et al. (Archaeol Anthropol Sci 1-20, 2015b, Grine et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 97:151-185, 1995), McHenry (Am J Phys Anthropol 87:407-431, 1992), Ruff et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 148:601-617, 2012), Ruff et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 86:397, 1991)). Our results support previous findings showing that body mass is predicted with lower accuracy than stature, even when population-specific equations are derived. However, the population-specific approach increases the agreement with the body mass estimated from the biiliac breadth and stature, particularly when sex-specific equations are used. Thus, our results advocate for the employment of sex-specific equations when possible and show that the possibility of deriving equation for each sex separately is the main advantage of the population-specific approach. The best agreement among the body mass techniques in the Central European Early Medieval samples was observed using the femoral head equations reported by Ruff et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 148:601-617, 2012) and McHenry (Am J Phys Anthropol 87:407-431, 1992), whereas other studied equations provided lower agreement.

Genomic Structure of Hstx2 Modifier of Prdm9-Dependent Hybrid Male Sterility in Mice,"F-1 hybrids between mouse inbred strains PWD and C57BL/6 represent the most thoroughly genetically defined model of hybrid sterility in vertebrates. Hybrid male sterility can be fully reconstituted from three components of this model, the Prdm9 gene, intersubspecific homeology of Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus autosomes, and the X-linked Hstx2 locus. Hstx2 modulates the extent of Prdm9-dependent meiotic arrest and harbors two additional factors responsible for intersubspecific introgression-induced oligospermia (Hstx1) and meiotic recombination rate (Meir1). To facilitate positional cloning and to overcome the recombination suppression within the 4.3 Mb encompassing the Hstx2 locus, we designed Hstx2-CRISPR and SPO11/Cas9 transgenes aimed to induce DNA double-strand breaks specifically within the Hstx2 locus. The resulting recombinant reduced the Hstx2 locus to 2.70 Mb (chromosome X: 66.51-69.21 Mb). The newly defined Hstx2 locus still operates as the major X-linked factor of the F-1 hybrid sterility, and controls meiotic chromosome synapsis and meiotic recombination rate. Despite extensive further crosses, the 2.70 Mb Hstx2 interval behaved as a recombination cold spot with reduced PRDM9-mediated H3K4me3 hotspots and absence of DMC1-defined DNA double-strand-break hotspots. To search for structural anomalies as a possible cause of recombination suppression, we used optical mapping and observed high incidence of subspecies-specific structural variants along the X chromosome, with a striking copy number polymorphism of the microRNA Mir465 cluster. This observation together with the absence of a strong sterility phenotype in Fmr1 neighbor (Fmr1nb) null mutants support the role of microRNA as a likely candidate for Hstx2.",10603.0,"Lustyk, Diana:Kinský, Slavomír:Ullrich, K.

Isoreticular UTL-Derived Zeolites as Model Materials for Probing Pore Size-Activity Relationship,"The relationship between the chemical composition and the activity of zeolites has been unambiguously established and used to optimize some reactions. However, the relationship between the micropore size and the activity of catalysts remains elusive. Here, we report the combination of the ADOR approach and postsynthetic alumination for the preparation of isoreticular Al-IPC materials as model catalysts to assess the effect of micropore size on their catalytic activity. XRD, SEM, N-2 ad-/desorption, chemical analysis, Al-27 NMR, and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed acetonitrile-d(3) show that the prepared isoreticular Al-IPC zeolites have similar Al content and coordination states as well as similar types and total numbers of acid sites but differ in micropore size, decreasing in the following order: Al-IPC-7 (14, 12, and 10-ring channels) &gt, Al-IPC-2 (12 and 10) &gt, Al-IPC-6 (12, 10, and 8) &gt, Al-IPC-4 (10 and 8). Furthermore, the kinetic study of gas-phase ethanol-to diethyl ether transformation evidenced a lack of confinement in ethanol dimers of IPC-6 and IPC-4 (k(first) = 0.4-0.9 mol(DEE) (mol(H+).s)(-1)) compared with IPC-2 (k(first) = 3.8 mol(DEE) (mol(H+).s)(-1)) and IPC-7 (k(first) = 6.3 mol(DEE) (mol(H+).s)(-1)) zeolites. The catalytic activity of IPC-zeolites in liquid-phase tetrahydropyranylation was correlated with the relative concentration of acid sites on the external surface of Al-IPC-n crystals, both increasing in the following order: IPC-4 (35% of &quot,external&quot, acid sites) &lt, IPC-6 (29%) &lt, IPC-2 (25%) &lt, IPC-7 (21%).

"Assessment of air pollution origin based on year-long parallel measurement of PM2.5and PM10 at two suburban sites in Prague, Czech Republic.","From 2nd April 2008 to 28th March 2009, a total 248 daily samples of the PM 2.5 and PM 10 were collected every sixth day parallel at two suburban sites (Libuš and Suchdol) located at the two opposite sides (south and north, respectively) of Prague, Czech Republic. The PM 2.5 samples were analyzed for ions by ion chromatography (IC), organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) by OC/EC analyzer and PM 10 samples also for 56 elements by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The average annual PM 2.5 and PM 10 was 24.4 ± 13.0 μg m −3 and 26.7 ± 15.1 μg m −3 , respectively, in Prague-Libuš and 25.1 ± 22.1 μg m −3 and 27.1 ± 23.2 μg m −3 , respectively, in Prague-Suchdol. Since the species forming large part of the aerosol mass were strongly correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r s > 0.80), the variability of PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentration was mainly driven by the local meteorology or regional and/or long range transport. PM 10 mass closure was calculated based on analytical results with the average percentage of recalculated mass of 77 ± 19% in Prague-Libuš and 86 ± 16% in Prague-Suchdol. The most abundant groups in PM 10 at both sites during the four seasons were OM (Prague-Libuš 34% and Prague-Suchdol 37%) and SIA (Prague-Libuš 30% and Prague-Suchdol 34%). The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was applied to the chemical composition of PM 10 from both sites (124 samples) together to determine its sources. The nine factors were assigned as: mixed factor secondary sulphate and biomass burning, secondary sulphate, traffic, secondary nitrate, road dust, residential heating, aged sea salt, industry and mixed factor road salt along with aged sea salt. According to the polar plots and ventilation index (VI) east/west classification analysis the sources were separated based on origin to four categories local, urban agglomeration, regional and long range transport (LRT). The mixed source secondary sulphate and biomass burning, residential heating and industry were common sources of local origin at both sites. Prague-Suchdol was influenced by traffic related pollution from the urban agglomeration more than Prague-Libuš where the traffic and road dust/salt were of local origin. The regional pollution by secondary sulphates and nitrate was also relevant at both sites along with long range transport of sea salt from North Atlantic Ocean, Norwegian Sea and North Sea. The contribution of the local sources to PM 10 was significant mainly at Prague-Libuš site. However, the sources of regional origin were also important and influence of urban agglomeration pollution to PM 10 is not negligible as well.",10509.0,"Schwarz, Jaroslav:Pokorná, Petra:Rychlík, Š.:Škáchová, H.:Vlček, O.:Smolík, Jiří:Ždímal, Vladimír:Hůnová, I.",Science of the Total Environment,3,low,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
"Nano-formulated curcumin (Lipodisq (TM)) modulates the local inflammatory response, reduces glial scar and preserves the white matter after spinal cord injury in rats","A highly water soluble, nano-formulated curcumin was used for the treatment of the experimental model of spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Nanocurcumin and a vehicle nanocarrier as a control, were delivered both locally, immediately after the spinal cord injury, and intraperitoneally during the 4 consecutive weeks after SCI. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed using behavioral tests, which were performed during the experiment, weekly for 9 weeks.

"Lifting,n-dimensional spectral resolutions, andn-dimensional observables","We show that under some natural conditions, we are able to lift an n-dimensional spectral resolution from one monotone sigma-complete unital po-group into another one, when the first one is a sigma-homomorphic image of the second one. We note that an n-dimensional spectral resolution is a mapping from R-n into a quantum structure which is monotone, left-continuous with non-negative increments and which is going to 0 if one variable goes to -infinity and it goes to 1 if all variables go to +infinity. Applying this result to some important classes of effect algebras including also MV-algebras, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between n-dimensional spectral resolutions and n-dimensional observables on these effect algebras which are a kind of sigma-homomorphisms from the Borel sigma-algebra of R-n into the quantum structure. An important used tool are two forms of the Loomis-Sikorski theorem which use two kinds of tribes of fuzzy sets.

Large RNA secondary structure conservation annotation using secondary structure-based MSA,"Identification of conserved regions of a set of RNA secondary structures is currently an open research problem when dealing with large RNA molecules such as ribosomal RNA. We designed and implemented a method for conservancy annotation of a set of RNA molecules using their secondary structures. The method first converts secondary structures into linear representations, which are then forwarded into multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The resulting secondary structure-based MSA is subsequently passed into a conservancy identification procedure which uses a sliding window technique to identify conserved position in the MSA and assign them a score based on the secondary structure content of the window. The algorithm can be used to rank overall conservancy of the structures, which generally denotes evolutionary distance, as well as to assign conservancy to individual bases to identify high- or lowconservancy regions. We tested the algorithm for correlation with evolutionary distance, where it matches the expectations.

They improve our understanding and provide tools for designing new learning paradigms. The advantages of mathematics, however, sometimes come with a cost. Gödel and Cohen showed, in a nutshell, that not everything is provable. Here we show that machine learning shares this fate. We describe simple scenarios where learnability cannot be proved nor refuted using the standard axioms of mathematics. Our proof is based on the fact the continuum hypothesis cannot be proved nor refuted. We show that, in some cases, a solution to the ‘estimating the maximum’ problem is equivalent to the continuum hypothesis.

Deformation behavior of Mg-alloy-based composites at different temperatures studied by neutron diffraction,"The influence of the reinforcement short Saffil fibers on the deformation behavior of Mg-Al-Ca alloy-based composite with two different fiber plane orientations is investigated and clarified using in-situ neutron diffraction at room and elevated temperatures. The measured lattice strain evolution points to a more efficient reinforcing effect of fibers at parallel fiber plane orientation, which decreases at elevated temperature. A significant decrement of compressive lattice strain was incidentally observed in the matrix in the direction of load axis when deformation due to the elevated temperature occurred.

Effects of build orientation and sample geometry on the mechanical response of miniature CP-Ti Grade 2 strut samples manufactured by laser powder bed fusion,"Additive manufacturing can produce a regular three-dimensional mesh containing tiny interconnected wires/struts that form a porous structure. It is reasonable to assume that the properties of these single wires/struts will affect the performance of each unit-cell contained within the porous structure and thereby affect the mechanical properties of the whole porous structure. The effects of strut geometry and build orientation on resulting mechanical properties are examined in this study. Laser powder bed fusion was used to manufacture single strut samples of CP-Ti Grade 2 in the vertical and horizontal orientations with cross-sectional areas ranging from 0.07 mm(2) to 2.3 mm(2). For samples with cross-sectional areas smaller than 1.5 mm(2), the difference in yield strength between the vertical and the horizontal build orientations was 79%, consistent with differences in microstructure scale in these orientations. Build orientation effects were much less pronounced in larger samples where the microstructural scale and features were similar. The presence of surface roughness and process-induced porosity contributed to the significant differences in ductility exhibited in the different orientations. The results indicate that build orientation effects may be significant for as-deposited surfaces and should be considered when designing porous structures consisting of thin struts since these will likely be used with as-deposited surface roughness.",20501.0,"Džugan, Jan:Koukolíková, Martina:Pehlivan, E.:Roudnická, M.:Králík, V.:Seifi, M.:Lewandowski, J.

Determinants of Women's Descriptive Representation on the City Boards of the Czech Statutory Cities after the Local Elections of 2014,"This paper focuses on question why is descriptive (or numerical) representation of women as local political leaders higher in some cities than in others? The paper focuses on the analysis of the determinants of women's political representation on city boards of the Czech statutory cities after the last local elections of 2014. We test some hypothesis, concerning two groups of factors that can potentially afefct the success of women (socioeconomic and demographic, and political contextual), thus aiming to expand theoretical and empirical research which is in the case of determinants of women's representation at the local level underdeveloped. Overall, the analysis reveals that regression models explaining presence of women on the city boards were not generally too successful, with slightly better performance of the model using socioeconomic and demographic factors. Specifially, Moravia and municipality size proved as very strong predictors of presence of women on the city boards in negative, or positive direction, respectively (although in full model municipality size variable lost its signifiance), supplementing by the proportion of female councillors in same elections, which increased successfulness of women as well. In contrast, the share of women in local councils and on city boards in the previous electoral term was not proven as statistical signifiant, similarly as party affiations' of city boards.",0.0,"Maškarinec, Pavel",Slovak Journal of Political Sciences,3,low,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bohr’s Complementarity Framework in Biosemiotics,"This paper analyses Bohr’s complementarity framework and applies it to biosemiotic studies by illustrating its application to three existing models of living systems: mechanistic (molecular) biology, Barbieri’s version of biosemiotics in terms of his code biology and Markoš’s phenomenological version of hermeneutic biosemiotics. The contribution summarizes both Bohr’s philosophy of science crowned by his idea of complementarity and his conception of the phenomenon of the living. Bohr’s approach to the biological questions evolved – among other things – from the consequences of an epistemological lesson of quantum theory and in light of complementarity of observer as a priori living creature and ex post scientific explanation of the living. In a manifestation of the phenomenon of the living, each model of living system and its description makes accessible – from its own presuppositions, contexts and concepts – some features which are not accessible from the others. Nevertheless, for a general understanding of that phenomenon, incompatible sophisticated approaches are equally necessary. Bohr’s epistemology of complementarity turns out to be a heuristic and methodical framework for testing the extent to which biosemiotics can become one of the special sciences or its potential as a cross-disciplinary branch of study.",10602.0,"Grygar, Filip",Biosemiotics,3,medium,medium,1,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
What does antidepressant drug level monitoring reveal about outpatient treatment and patient adherence?,"INTRODUCTION: The evaluation of plasma levels of antidepressants may improve the treatment outcome. The aim was to verify adherence and adequacy of administered doses of antidepressants among patients hospitalized for inadequate outpatient therapeutic response. METHODS: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or venlafaxine plasma levels were assessed on the first day of hospitalization and after 3 days of controlled administration. The patients were considered adherent if the plasma level on admission was within the interval of the minimum and maximum plasma level on the fourth day, expanded by 30%. The adequacy of antidepressant doses used during the outpatient treatment was assessed by comparing the plasma level on the fourth day with the therapeutic reference range. RESULTS: Out of 83 patients, 52 (62.7%) were adherent. The plasma levels of antidepressants on the fourth day were found to be within the therapeutic reference range in 35 (43.2%) patients. The same number manifested levels below the therapeutic reference range. In 11 (13.6%) patients, the levels were higher than recommended. No significant difference in rate of adherence was found among individual antidepressants.

Ouroboros: Early identification of at-risk students without models based on legacy data,"This paper focuses on the problem of identifying students, who are at risk of failing their courses, with the absence of the data from previous runs of the courses, which are usually used for training the machine learning models. This problem is typically related to newly opened courses. To tackle this issue we present the ""Ouroboros"" based on the concept of ""Self-Learning"". It builds the machine learning models from the data in the currently running course. Moreover most of the students who fail the course withdraw in the first weeks of the course, therefore the focus is on identifying at-risk students as early as possible. The approach utilises information about already submitted assessments. This raises another problem that needs to be treated -- the presence of imbalanced data for training and testing the classification models.    There are three main contributions in this paper -- 1) the concept of training the models for identifying at-risk students using the data from the same running course, 2) specifying the problem as a classification task and 3) tackling the problem of imbalanced data, which appears both in training and testing set.   The results prove  validity of the concept and show that it stands a comparison with traditional approaches of learning the models from legacy course data.",10201.0,"Hlosta, Martin:Zdráhal, Zdeněk:Zendulka, Jaroslav",LAK '17 Proceedings of the Seventh International Learning Analytics & Knowledge Conference,3,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Technique selection in young female gymnasts: Elbow and wrist joint loading during the cartwheel and round-off,"Biophysical loading of the elbow and wrist is a potential reason for chronic lesions in gymnastics and present a real concern for coaches, scientist and clinicians. Previous research has identified injury risk factors during round-off (RO) skills in elite female gymnasts. The aim of this study was to investigate key elbow and wrist joint injury risk factors during different techniques of fundamental cartwheel (CW) and RO skills performed by young female artistic gymnasts. Seventeen active young female gymnasts performed 30 successful trials of both CW and RO from a hurdle step with three different hand positions (parallel (10), T-shape (10) and reverse (10)). Synchronised kinematic (240 Hz) and kinetic (1200 Hz) data were collected for each trial. One-way repeated measures ANOVA and effect size (ES) were used for statistical analysis. The results showed statistically significant differences (P?&lt,.05) and large ES (&gt,0.8) among hand positions for peak vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), peak elbow compression force, peak wrist compression force, elbow internal adduction moment and wrist dorsiflexion angle. In conclusion, the parallel and reverse techniques increase peak VGRF, elbow and wrist compression forces, and elbow internal adduction moment. These differences indicate that the parallel and reverse techniques may increase the potential of elbow and wrist injuries in young gymnasts compared with the T-shape technique, this is of particular importance with the high frequency of the performance of these fundamental skills.",30306.0,"Farana, Roman:Exell, Timothy:Strutzenberger, Gerda:Irwin, Gareth",EUR J SPORT SCI,3,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Part-Time Employment in Central and Eastern Europe: A Cross-Country Analysis,"This chapter explores part-time employment in Central and Eastern European countries (CEE) as compared to Western Europe. The aim is to examine the relationship between part-time work and labour utilisation in CEE, and to evaluate whether a potential expansion of part-time employment may facilitate growth in labour utilisation. The analyses on panel data identify the main determinants of part-time employment and the key factors that limit it in CEE. The results indicate that part-time employment of prime-aged men was largely driven by business cycle trends, expanding mostly at the expense of full-time positions and had no significant relationship to labour market inactivity in CEE. In contrast, for both young and older workers, part-time employment had a positive relationship to the employment rate, it was often a viable option to inactivity and may bring about higher labour utilisation. Further, our results suggest that, so far, the growth in prime-aged female part-time work was mainly at the expense of a shrinking pool of the inactive and was positively related to the total prime-aged female employment rate and labour participation in CEE.",50202.0,"Fialová, Kamila",Labour Market Institutions and Productivity: Labour Utilisation in Central and Eastern Europe,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Inventory and Typology of Landslide-Dammed Lakes if the Cordillera Blanca (Peru),"The main objective of this study is to provide inventory of landslide-dammed lakes in the Cordillera Blanca, overview on their typology and discuss their geomorphological significance exemplified by two case studies. Existing, failed and infilled landslide-dammed lakes are simultaneously present in the area of interest. Three sub-types of existing landslide-dammed lakes are distinguished: (i) landslide/rockslide-dammed lakes situated in the main valleys, (ii) debris cone-dammed lakes situated in the main valleys, (iii) lakes situated on landslide bodies irrespective their location. Lakes of sub-types (i) and (ii) reach significant sizes, while lakes of sub-type (iii) do not. The dam formation of lake sub-types (i) and (iii) is usually connected with a single event, while the dams of sub-type (ii) are usually formed by several generations of debris deposition over time. It was shown, that landslide-dammed lakes in the study area are characterized by relatively low mean lake water level elevation (4115 m a.s.l.) and large catchments (in some cases up to 80 km2 ), compared to other lake types. Lakes of sub-type (ii) are predominantly situated in central glacierized part of the Cordillera Blanca, while lakes of sub-types (i) and (iii) are situated rather in the already deglaciated piedmont areas, reflecting the conditions and mechanisms of dam formation. Two illustrative examples are, further, studied in detail: rockslide-dammed Lake Purhuay close Huari in Marañon River catchment, debris cone-dammed Lake Jatuncocha in Santa Cruz valley, Santa River catchment.",10508.0,"Emmer, Adam:Juřicová, Anna",Advancing Culture of Living with Landslides : Landslides in Different Environments,3,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do freshwater fish sperm find the egg? The physicochemical factors guiding the gamete encounters of externally fertilizing freshwater fish,"The lifespan of spermatozoa from externally fertilizing freshwater fish ranges from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the species. External factors, such as temperature, background flows and ion composition, play an important role in fertilization success. Specific mechanisms guiding spermatozoa appear to be essential to maximize the sperm-egg encounter under these strenuous conditions. Although some existing data support the hypothesis that both the ovarian fluid and the eggs may release chemoattractants that significantly affect spermatozoa behaviour and the fertilization outcome, this hypothesis is still open to debate, as the existence of freshwater fish spermatozoa chemotaxis has yet to be demonstrated, in addition, specific mechanisms supporting spermatozoa guidance and gamete selection have not been elucidated. Is the natural selection of gametes determined by a combination of different physicochemical phenomena? Alternatively, is the natural selection of species-specific gametes biased towards the species-specific guidance mechanisms of their natural landscape? These questions have received more attention as new studies have revealed potential, distinct guidance mechanisms in freshwater fish reproduction. In this review, we discuss the empirical studies supporting different hypotheses about freshwater fish gamete guidance and highlight the synergistic combination of experiments and biomathematical modelling to explore these questions. Finally, we discuss the challenges in understanding the mechanisms behind sperm guidance in freshwater fish species, and we suppose that knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie spermatozoa selection and guidance in freshwater fish species may elucidate the impact of the traditional aquaculture practice of artificial fertilization on progeny quality and species sustainability.",10604.0,"Kholodnyy, Vitaliy:Buarque Gadelha, Hermes Augusto:Cosson, Jacky:Boryshpolets, Sergey",Reviews in Aquaculture,3,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Multiaxial fatigue strength of common structural steel and the response of some estimation methods,"This paper describes the multiaxial fatigue strengths obtained from a series of load-controlled fatigue experiments in the high-cycle fatigue domain. The experiments were carried out on unnotched specimens manufactured from common structural steel CSN 41 1523. Various load combinations were induced, including some rare combinations, e.g. a combination of pressurizing and plane bending. The stress states on the inner surface and also on the outer surface of hollow specimens are therefore evaluated in the subsequent fatigue strength analyses. The goal of the paper is to derive a new solution for estimating multiaxial fatigue strength that will better conform to the described experiments than the Manson-McKnight method, but which will keep its simplicity of calculation. Our final proposal – the MMP criterion – is compared with various versions of the Manson-McKnight method, and also with four multiaxial methods (Dang Van, Liu-Zenner, Crossland and Papuga PCr). The results for the MMP criterion are quite motivating, thanks to the simplicity of the computational algorithm and the quality of the prediction output, which is comparable with the output of the evaluated multiaxial methods. However, the set of experiments described here is not large enough either for more thorough statistical analyses of prediction quality, or for more enhanced improvement of the MMP criterion, which would include e.g. the effect of non-proportional loading.",20302.0,"Papuga, Jan:Fojtík, F.",International Journal of Fatigue,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Evaluation of Toxicological and Teratogenic Effects of Carbosilane Glucose Glycodendrimers in Zebrafish Embryos and Model Rodent Cell Lines.,"Glycodendrimers (Glyco-DDMs) represent a rapidly growing class of nanoparticles with promising properties for biomedical applications but concerns regarding the impact on human health and environment are still justified. Here we report, for the first time, the comparative study of in vivo developmental toxicity of carbosilane Glyco-DDMs and their cytotoxicity in vitro. Carbosilane Glyco-DDMs (generation 1-3) containing 4, 8, and 16 beta-d-glucopyranosyl units at the periphery (DDM1Glu, DDM2Glu, and DDM3Glu) were synthesized and characterized by 1H, 13C and 29Si NMR, mass spectrometry, dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and computer modeling. In vitro cytotoxicity assay (MTT) of DDM1-3Glu was performed on three different rodent cell lines (Cricetulus griseus) - B14 (ATCC, CCL-14.1), BRL 3A (ATCC, CRL-1442), and NRK 52E (ATCC, CRL-1571). Overall, very low cytotoxicity was observed with calculated IC50 in mM range with slight difference between each cell line and DDM generation investigated. Modified fish embryo test (FET) was further used for DDM3Glu developmental toxicity testing on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. While seemingly harmless to intact embryos, adverse effects of DDMs on the embryonic development become evident after chorion removal (LD50=2.78M at 96hpe). We summarized that the modified FET test showed a two to three orders of magnitude difference between the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo developmental toxicity of DDM3Glu. While, in general, the Glyco-DDMs show great promises as efficient vectors in targeted drug delivery or as therapeutic molecules itself, we suggest that their developmental toxicity should be thoroughly investigated to exclude safety risks associated with their potential biomedical use.",30108.0,"Liegertová, M.:Wróbel, D.:Herma, R.:Müllerová, Monika:Červenková Šťastná, Lucie:Cuřínová, Petra:Strašák, Tomáš:Malý, M.:Čermák, Jan:Smejkal, J.:Štofik, M.:Malý, J.",Nanotoxicology,3,low,high,1,0,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
On the Practice of Amending or Supplementing EU Directives by EU Delegated Regulations,"In the EU legislative practice, legislative directives (their non-essential elements) are sometimes supplemented or amended by EU delegated regulations, that is, not by EU delegated directives, as one would reasonably expect, given the quite different nature and effects of EU directives and EU regulations. This question-begging practice has rather significant implications especially for the national transposition and application of the legal acts in question. The purpose of this contribution is to identify and analyse these implications. The analysis leads to two conclusions. First, the provisions of an EU directive that were amended by an EU delegated regulation can and should as a rule be transposed into national legislation, but without concealing the fact that they were amended by an EU regulation. Secondly, the provisions of an EU delegated regulation that supplement certain non-essential elements of an EU legislative directive cannot as a rule be transposed into a national legislative measure transposing the (supplemented) directive in question. However, specific normative measures must be taken on the national level for the sake of ensuring full application in a sufficiently clear and precise manner of both the supplemented EU directive and the supplementing EU delegated regulation.",50501.0,"Král, Richard",European Law Review,3,low,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fenofibrate Decreases Hepatic P-Glycoprotein in a Rat Model of Hereditary Hypertriglyceridemia,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a membrane-bound transporter encoded by Mdr1a/Abcb1a and Mdr1b/Abcb1b genes in rodents involved in the efflux of cytotoxic chemicals and metabolites from cells. Modulation of its activity influences P-gp-mediated drug delivery and drug-drug interaction (DDI). In the current study, we tested the effects of fenofibrate on P-gp mRNA and protein content in non-obese model of metabolic syndrome. Males hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rats (HHTg) were fed standard laboratory diet (STD) (Controls) supplemented with micronized fenofibrate in lower (25 mg/kg b. wt./day) or in higher (100 mg/kg b. wt./day) dose for 4 weeks. Liver was used for the subsequent mRNA and protein content analysis. Fenofibrate in lower dose decreased hepatic Mdr1a by 75% and Mdr1b by 85%, while fenofibrate in higher dose decreased Mdr1a by 90% and Mdr1b by 92%. P-gp protein content in the liver was decreased by 74% in rat treated with fenofibrate at lower dose and by 88% in rats using fenofibrate at higher dose. These findings demonstrate for the first time that fenofibrate decreases both mRNA and protein amount of P-gp and suggest that fenofibrate could affect bioavailability and interaction of drugs used to treat dyslipidemia-induced metabolic disorders.",30104.0,"Poruba, Martin:Matušková, Zuzana:Hüttl, Martina:Malínská, Hana:Oliyarnyk, Olena:Marková, Irena:Gurská, Soňa:Kazdová, Ludmila:Večeřa, Rostislav",Frontiers in Pharmacology,3,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Art and ""Madness"": Weapons of the Marginal during Socialism in Eastern Europe","In this chapter, I analyze subtle forms of artistic/everyday resistance during the late socialist period in Eastern Europe, focusing on the artistic practice of several artists who were considered ""mad."" I survey several individual forms of artistic self-estrangement, arguing that political resistance can take place in different force fields: not only in mainstream institutions and in the public sphere, but also in the remote zones of the ""inner self"" where one's inherent ""reality"" and its subversive performance become the expression of an existen-tial rebellion. In addition to explicit forms of artis-tic opposition like ""defying authority"" or ""beating the system,"" which overtly and publicly questioned the legitimacy of the regime, there were also subtle forms of resistance such as feigning madness or obsessively documenting the ""average everydayness"" of socialist everyday life. The association between critical art and madness is not accidental. Many artists throughout the Eastern bloc spent years in mental institutions (or were confined to their home and placed under a physician's supervision) although many of them did not actu-ally have a mental disorder. In this case, psychiatry was used as a means of social and political control and sham psychiatric diagnoses were imposed on perfectly sane people. However, one could analyze the other side of the same coin, namely situations in which mental hospitals or/and the invocation of ""madness"" were used to protect people from worse fates at the hands of the regime.",0.0,"Asavei, Maria Alina",Dropping out of Socialism,3,high,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
PageRank-based prediction of award-winning researchers and the impact of citations,"In this article some recent disputes about the usefulness of PageRank-based methods for the task of identifying influential researchers in citation networks are discussed. In particular, it focuses on the performance of these methods in relation to simple citation counts. With the aim of comparing these two classes of ranking methods, we analyze a large citation network of authors based on almost two million computer science papers and apply four PageRank based and citations-based techniques to rank authors by importance throughout the period 1990–2014 on a yearly basis. We use ACM SIGMOD E. F. Codd Innovations Award and ACM A. M. Turing Award winners in our baseline lists of outstanding scientists and define four relevance weighting schemes with some predictive power for the ranking methods to increase the relevance of researchers winning in the future. We conclude that citations-based rankings perform better for Codd Award winners, but PageRank-based methods do so for Turing Award recipients when using absolute ranks and PageRank-based rankings outperform the citations-based techniques for both Codd and Turing Award laureates when relative ranks are considered.

Under Pressure: Building Judicial Resistance to Political Inference,"Recent constitutional reforms targeting designs of domestic judiciaries have reminded us both how important and how fragile judicial independence is. Current episodes from Hungary and Poland have shown that domestic courts are an easy target for governments enjoying large parliamentary majorities. Moreover, we have learnt that political leaders implement a plethora of formal and informal methods of interference, skilfully using the pretence of legal language. Courts, however, are not completely helpless observers of court-curbing: far from it. Depending on the aims and formality of political inferences, courts can implement various ways of retaliating aimed at preventing, averting, or punishing the inferences of executives. While the major part of research focuses on institutional design safeguarding judicial independence, this chapter analyses resistance strategies – reactions implemented by courts facing political inference. It identifies four categories of judicial resistance and, using an example of Central European countries, demonstrates that their implementation depends on the formality and motives with which executives aim to capture the courts.",50501.0,"Šipulová, Katarína",The Courts and the People: Friend or Foe?

The existence of two or more Kähler metrics underlying a given c-projective structure has many ramifications, which we explore in depth. As a consequence of this analysis, we prove the Yano–Obata Conjecture for complete Kähler manifolds: if such a manifold admits a one parameter group of c-projective transformations that are not affine, then it is complex projective space, equipped with a multiple of the Fubini–Study metric.",10101.0,"Calderbank, David M.

Diagnostic deep-targeted next-generation sequencing assessment of TP53 gene mutations in multiple myeloma from the whole bone marrow,"Among the important markers of poor prognosis in multiple myeloma (MM) are aberrations in TP53 gene (Manier et al., 2017), caused by the deletion and/or mutation in TP53 gene (TP53mut). The detection of del(17p) is a part of the recommended risk assessment in newly diagnosed MM (Kumar et al., 2017). However, TP53 mutation analysis in MM is not widely performed in diagnostics, particularly due to technical limitations regarding sample collection and plasma cell (PC) enrichment. The pitfalls are mainly connected with inter‐individual variability in the sample amount, PC infiltration in bone marrow (BM), PC immunophenotypes and time‐dependent losses of surface markers as well as haemodilution, patchy or site varied PC distribution, aspirate pull order and aggregation of PC in aspirated BM (Mansilla et al., 2018, Romano et al., 2019), all together resulting in low PC recovery in some patients. Therefore, there is a need to standardise the pre‐processing of BM in clinical settings, as well as to have an alternative, when enriched tumour PCs are not available.

In the name of scientific precision: Václav Havel's Ptydepe,"In Vyrozumění (Memorandum) Václav Havel introduces Ptydepe, an artificial language. In this play, Ptydepe is conceived as a much more &quot,precise&quot, language than natural languages - its grammar is &quot,maximally rational&quot, and its words tend to be long and numerous because they are maximally (redundantly) differentiated from one another. Ptydepe lacks not only homonyms, but also words that are minimally differentiated. Use of this language leads to increasingly long texts and becomes thus unusable. Finally, it is replaced by Chorukor, another artificial language built on similarity, which leads to extreme ambiguity. This study examines functions of Ptydepe in the play from several angles: direct observation of the Ptydepe texts, the metalinguistic description of the language, the discourse features of the characters&apos, first language (L1), and a comparison between Ptydepe and socialist political speeches. The quantitative analysis of Ptydepe empirically demonstrates the degree to which Ptydepe departs from a natural language. Both qualitative and quantitative data show the mechanism by which language can be manipulated to the point of sheer automation. Ptydepe exposes the extreme essence of the socialist language, which in turn reveals features of a more subtle manipulative language found elsewhere, including in a democratic political system.",60203.0,"Fidler, Masako:Cvrček, Václav",Slavic and East European Journal,3,high,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
The Czech Republic: From a Euro-Friendly Approach of the Constitutional Court to Proclaiming a Court of Justice Judgment Ultra Vires,"The Czech Constitution of 1992, associated with the revolutionary fervour of the 1989 Velvet Revolution, attempted to annihilate the Communist, totalitarian heritage. According to the judgments of the Constitutional Court (CCC), this meant that the rule of law in a constitutional state has not only a formal but also a substantive side, expressing the fundamental, inviolable values of a democratic society. There was a break from an approach that had seen the judiciary as a submissive and unthinking instrument of enforcement. In relation to EU law, several measures have been subject to constitutional challenges, including domestic acts implementing the European Arrest Warrant, the Data Retention Directive, and EU sugar quotas. The Czech Constitutional Court, which has a strong position, has underlined its EU-friendly approach. At the same time, for exceptional, flagrant cases, the CCC has retained the constitutional limits based on the democratic, rule-of-law-based state (unamendable provision under Art. 9(2) of the Constitution) and the protection of fundamental rights. Notably, in Landtová, the CCC declared an ECJ judgment ultra vires. In general, the reasoning of the CCC often follows that of the German Constitutional Court. In the practice of the ordinary courts, it emerges from the report that the Czech courts have adopted a rights-protective approach and carry out judicial review, including in European Arrest Warrant cases and other mutual recognition cases.

"Sedimentary record and anthropogenic pollution of a complex, multiple source fed dam reservoirs: An example from the Nové Mlýny reservoir, Czech Republic","While numerous studies of dam reservoirs contamination are reported world-wide, we present a missing link in the study of reservoirs sourced from multiple river catchments. In such reservoirs, different point sources of contaminants and variable composition of their sedimentary matrices add to extremely complex geochemical patterns. We studied a unique, step-wise filled Nové Mlýny dam reservoir, Czech Republic, which consists of three interconnected sub-basins. Their source areas are located in units with contrasting geology and different levels and sources of contamination. The aim of this study is to provide an insight into the provenance of the sediment, including lithogenic elements and anthropogenic pollutants, to investigate the sediment dispersal across the reservoir, and to assess the heavy metal pollution in each basin. The study is based on multi-proxy stratigraphic analysis and geochemistry of sediment cores. There is a considerable gradient in the sediment grain size, brightness, MS and geochemistry, which reflects changing hydrodynamic energy conditions and primary pelagic production of CaCO3. The thickness of sediments generally decreases from proximal to distal parts, but underwater currents can accumulate higher amounts of sediments in distal parts near the thalweg line. Average sedimentation rates vary over a wide range from 0.58 cm/yr to 2.33 cm/yr. In addition, the petrophysical patterns, concentrations of lithogenic elements and their ratios made it possible to identify two main provenance areas, the Dyje River catchment (upper basin) and the Svratka and Jihlava River catchments (middle and lower basin). Enrichment factors (EF) were used for distinguishing the anthropogenic element contribution from the local background levels. We found moderate Zn and Cu pollution (EF ~ 2 to 5) in the upper basin and Zn, Cu and Pb (EF ~ 2 to 4.5) in the middle basin with the peak contamination in the late 1980s.",10505.0,"Sedláček, Jan:Bábek, Ondřej:Nováková, Tereza",Science of the Total Environment,3,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Variability and Uncertainty Challenges in Scaling Imaging Spectroscopy Retrievals and Validations from Leaves Up to Vegetation Canopies,"Imaging spectroscopy of vegetation requires methods for scaling and generalizing optical signals that are reflected, transmitted and emitted in the solar wavelength domain from single leaves and observed at the level of canopies by proximal sensing, airborne and satellite spectroradiometers. The upscaling embedded in imaging spectroscopy retrievals and validations of plant biochemical and structural traits is challenged by natural variability and measurement uncertainties. Sources of the leaf-to-canopy upscaling variability and uncertainties are reviewed with respect to: (1) implementation of retrieval algorithms and (2) their parameterization and validation of quantitative products through in situ field measurements. The challenges are outlined and discussed for empirical and physical leaf and canopy radiative transfer modelling components, considering both forward and inverse modes. Discussion on optical remote sensing validation schemes includes also description of a multiscale validation concept and its advantages. Impacts of intraspecific and interspecific variability on collected field and laboratory measurements of leaf biochemical traits and optical properties are demonstrated for selected plant species, and field measurement uncertainty sources are listed and discussed specifically for foliar pigments and canopy leaf area index.

Elaborating the Philosophical Dimensions: The Development of Historical-Comparative Sociology in Johann Pall Arnason's Civilizational Analysis,"This article deals with the work of the Icelandic sociologist and philosopher Johann Pall Arnason (*1940) and with his concept of 'civilizational analysis', which is nowadays understood as a subdiscipline of historical-comparative sociology. More precisely, I want to show that Arnason's original interpretation of civilizational analysis goes beyond the mainstream understanding of historical sociology as a dialogue between history and sociology in favour of philosophical approaches. By outlining the three levels of Arnason's civilizational analysis - (I.) the reconstruction of the concept of 'civilization', incl. its history, (II.) the link to philosophical sources and (III.) the theoretical development of Eisenstadt's heritage - the article shows that, according to Arnason, the concept of 'civilization' is understood as the field of convergence of the historical-sociological concepts of 'culture' (Max Weber, Shmuel N. Eisenstadt) on the one hand, and the philosophical concepts of the 'world' (Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jan Patočka, Cornelius Castoriadis) on the other. Arnason thus, defining 'culture' as the so-called 'interpretative articulation of the world', emphasizes the motif of 'cultural creativity', which is present, yet theoretically underdeveloped, both in Weber's and Eisenstadt's work. In this light, the article finally focuses on Arnason's most recent attempts to discuss Eisenstadt's concept of the 'civilizational dimension' of modernity. It deals primarily with the terms 'cultural ontology' and 'civilizational paradox', in which the need to link historical sociology to philosophical perspectives is most evident. The civilizational approach is thus introduced as the crucial framework of Arnason's elaboration of the philosophical dimensions in sociological analysis.",0.0,"Homolka, Jakub",Social Imaginaries,3,low,high,0,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bioplastic Fibers from Gum Arabic for Greener Food Wrapping Applications,"The fabrication of bioplastic fibers from gum arabic (GA), a natural tree gum exudate, is described via the electrospinning method. The enrichment in surface properties of this bioplastic fiber was evaluated by methane plasma and γ-ray irradiation treatments. The fibers with their modified forms, both treated and untreated, were investigated by various characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction and attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, BET surface area, water contact angle, and tensile strength measurements. A switchable hydrophobic/hydrophilic functionality on GA bioplastic fibers was established through CH4 plasma and γ-ray irradiation treatments, higher water contact angle (130°) was observed in GA bioplastic fibers that had undergone methane plasma treatment. However, the untreated and γ-ray-irradiated GA bioplastics exhibited hydrophilic behavior. The comparative properties such as water resistance, antioxidant potency, gas barrier attributes, antibacterial effectiveness, biodegradability and food contact migration through the GA bioplastic fibers (untreated, plasma-treated, and γ-ray-irradiated) were assessed.

An efficiency of the overlay mode fully depends on the activity of macrocell users (MUEs), since insufficient resources remain for small cell users (SUEs). Contrarily, the main weakness of the underlay mode is that it can result in low transmission efficiency due to restricted transmission power. Apart from the transmission efficiency of both modes, an energy consumption of the SCs should not be disregarded. Thus, we propose a centralized scheme selecting the spectrum sharing mode in the downlink, according to both the SUEs' throughput and the energy consumption of the SCs. The objective is to maximize the overall performance of the SCs, while their energy consumption is taken into account. Then, we also propose a distributed algorithm in order to decrease complexity and signaling overhead of the centralized scheme. The results show that the proposed dynamic selection significantly outperforms all competitive schemes in terms of the SUEs' throughput, while the throughput of MUEs is intact, and only negligible signaling overhead is generated in the case of the proposed distributed algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is able to notably decrease the energy consumption of the SCs.",20201.0,"Mach, Pavel:Bečvář, Zdeněk",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The proportion of the key components analysed in collagen-based isolates from fish and mammalian tissues processed by different protocols,"The aim of this pilot study is to compare two extraction processes tested in our lab with intention to preserve the biological structure and functions of collagen-based isolate for biomedical purposes during its processing. Collagen type I was isolated from various animal sources from fish, porcine and rat skins. The resulting isolates, along with commercial calf collagens as control, were subsequently characterised and their composition examined by means of several analytical methods such as amino acid analysis, FTIR, SDS-PAGE. Moreover, the moisture, lipid, glycosaminoglycans, hydroxyproline and N contents were determined. We found that both the factors considered, the source of the collagen and the process employed, exerted effects on the final composition of the isolate and we monitored the key differences, in particular, with respect to the protein and lipid contents. Moreover, the study provides a discussion of issues surrounding the assessment of the actual pure collagen content determined on the basis of the content of hydroxyproline and the purity of the protein fraction.",20903.0,"Rýglová, Šárka:Braun, Martin:Hříbal, Miloň:Suchý, Tomáš:Vöröš, Dominik",Journal of Food Composition and Analysis,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Impact of Nanoparticles on Protozoa,"Protozoa (unicellular eukaryotes) are wild or parasitic organisms that feed on organic matter, such as other microorganisms or organic tissues and debris. Protozoans have historically been considered &quot,unicellular animals&quot, because they are characterized by animal-like behaviors such as mobility and predation, and lack the cell wall and photosynthesis capability, such as in plants and algae. Protozoa are spread everywhere: in fresh and saltwater, in soil, on the surface and inside animals and plants. They play an important role in ecology, they are part of the plankton. On the other hand, parasitic protozoa, which cause severe and often life-threatening diseases of animals and humans represent a special group. These diseases are often classified as so-called neglected diseases, which mainly occur in third-world countries for which there is not enough modern and effective treatment. Nanoscale science and nanotechnology have unambiguously demonstrated to have a great potential in providing novel and improved solutions. Nano-size materials change their physical and chemical properties in comparison with bulk materials and have helped to improve and innovate a variety of pharmaceutical, medical, industrial, and agricultural products. On the other hand, originally nontoxic/nonhazardous bulk materials/substances become potentially toxic in nanoscale systems due to their ultrafine particle size. These adverse cellular effects in living organisms have been attributed to the high chemical surface reactivity of NPs. This chapter gives a comprehensive overview of recent findings related to the biological activity of various types of nanoparticles against pathogenic protozoa. The impact of various nanoformulations on the environment, including potential deleterious effects on nontarget organisms, is discussed as well.",21000.0,"Plachá, Daniela:Jampílek, Josef",Nanotechnology in Medicine : Toxicity and Safety,3,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Spatial lag effect of aridity and nitrogen deposition on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) damage,"Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is a widespread tolerant forest tree-species, however, its adaptability to environmental change differs among sites with various buffering capacity. In this study, we compared the spatial effects of aridity index (AI) and nitrogen deposition (ND) on biomass density in natural and man-made pine stands of differing soil fertility using geographically weighted multiple lag regression. Soil fertility was defined using soil series as zonal trophic (27.9%), acidic (48.2%), gleyed (15.2%) and as azonal exposed (2.5%), maple (2.4%), ash (0.8%), wet (2.1%) and peat (0.9%) under pine stands in the Czech Republic (Central Europe, 4290.5 km2, 130-1298 m a.s.l.). Annual AI and ND in every pine stand were estimated by intersection between raster and vector from 1 x 1 km grid for years 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010 of severe non-specific forest damage spread. Biomass density was obtained from a MODIS 250 x 250 m raster using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for years 2000-2015, with a decrease in EVI indicating non-specific damage. Environmental change was assessed by comparing predictor values at EVI time t and t+λ. Non-specific damage was registered over 51.9% of total forest area. Less than 8.8% of damaged stands were natural and the rest (91.2%) of damaged stands were man-made. Pure pine stands were more damaged than mixed. The ND effect prevailed up to 2007, while AI dominated later. Temporal increasing ND effect under AI effectiveness led to the most significant pine stand damage in 2008 and 2014. Predictors from 2000 to 2007 afflicted 58.5% of non-specifically damaged stands at R2 0.09-0.76 (median 0.38), but from 2000 to 2010 afflicted 57.1% of the stands at R2 0.16-0.75 (median 0.40). The most damaged stands occurred on acidic sites.

Aluminum and gallium substitution in yttrium and lutetium aluminumgallium garnets: investigation by single-crystal NMR and TSL methods,The work reports the results on 71Ga and 27Al NMR investigation of the gallium and aluminum ions distribution over tetrahedral and octahedral positions in the Y3Al(5-x)GaxO12:Ce single crystals and Lu3Al(5-x)GaxO12:Ce single crystalline epitaxial films. The gallium content x varies between 0-5 in crystals and 0.3-2 in films. We find that in both the Y and Lu-based solid solutions the larger gallium ions are preferably located at the tetrahedral position while the smaller aluminum ions prefer the octahedral position of the garnet host.

CHAT gene polymorphism rs3810950 is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in the Czech population,"Background: Cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on the findings that a reduced and/or perturbed cholinergic activity in the central nervous system correlates with cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The hypothesis resulted in the development of centrally-acting agents potentiating cholinergic neurotransmission, these drugs, however, only slowed down the cognitive decline and could not prevent it Consequently, the perturbation of the central cholinergic signalling has been accepted as a part of the Alzheimer's aetiology but not necessarily the primary cause of the disease. In the present study we have focused on the rs3810950 polymorphism of ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) gene that has not been studied in Czech population before. Methods: We carried out an association study to test for a relationship between the rs3810950 polymorphism arid Alzheimer's disease in a group of 1186 persons, 759 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 427 control subjects. Furthermore, we performed molecular modelling of the terminal domain (1st-126th amino acid residue) of one of the ChAT isoforms (M) to visualise in silico whether the rs3810950 polymorphism (A120T) can change any features of the tertiary structure of the protein which would have a potential to alter its function. Results: The AA genotype of CHAT was associated with a 1.25 times higher risk of AD (p &lt, 0.002) thus demonstrating that the rs3810950 polymorphism can have a modest but statistically significant effect on the risk of AD in the Czech population. Furthermore, the molecular modelling indicated that the polymorphism is likely to be associated with significant variations in the tertiary structure of the protein molecule which may impact its enzyme activity. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with the results of the meta-analytical studies of the relationship between rs3810950 polymorphism and AD and provide further material evidence for a direct (primary) involvement of cholinergic mechanisms in the etiopathogenesis of AD, particularly as a factor in cognitive decline and perturbed conscious awareness commonly observed in patients with AD.",10608.0,"Hálová, Alice:Janoutova, Jana:Ewerlingová, Laura:Janout, Vladimír:Bonczek, Ondřej:Zeman, Tomáš:Gerguri, Tereza:Balcar, Vladimír Josef:Šerý, Omar",Journal of Biomedical Science,3,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Pieces of people in the Pavlovian: burials, body parts and bones in the earlier Upper Palaeolithic","The rich earlier Mid-Upper Palaeolithic (Pavlovian) sites of Dolní Věstonice I and II and Pavlov I (32,000–30,000 cal BP) in southern Moravia (Czech Republic) have yielded a series of human burials, isolated pairs of extremities and isolated bones and teeth. The burials occurred within and adjacent to the remains of structures (‘huts’), among domestic debris. Two of them were adjacent to mammoth bone dumps, but none of them was directly associated with areas of apparent discard (or garbage). The isolated pairs and bones/teeth were haphazardly scattered through the occupation areas, many of them mixed with the small to medium-sized faunal remains, from which many were identified post-excavation. It is therefore difficult to establish a pattern of disposal of the human remains with respect to the abundant evidence for site structure at these Upper Palaeolithic sites. At the same time, each form of human preservation raises questions about the differential mortuary behaviours, and hence social dynamics, of these foraging populations and how we interpret them through an archaeological lens.",50404.0,"Trinkaus, Erik:Sázelová, Sandra:Svoboda, Jiří",Human Remains and Violence,3,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Russian View of a “Peripheral” Region. Nikodim P. Kondakov and the Southern Caucasus,"Because of the late nineteenth-century studies of Russian scholars, our understanding of medieval Caucasus seems to be largely determinate by the Russian imperial aspiration during the reign of Alexander III (1881–1894) and Nicolas I (1894– 1917). For these Tsars, the Caucasus was, before all, a uniform region with no distinction between Armenia and Georgia. Following this idea, scholars like Nikodim P. Kondakov (1844–1825) or Dimitrij Bakradze (1826–1890) presented the medieval region as a homogenous phenomenon, regardless of the cultural and political reality of the Middle ages. Through the imperial glance, the Caucasus was just the periphery of an international empire. In the same way, the medieval artistic cultures of the southern Caucasus were presented by the aforementioned scholars as a cultural periphery of the Byzantine world. Despite of the incredible quality of Georgian enamels or of the Armenian architecture, the art of this region was thus considered provincial.",0.0,"Foletti, Ivan","Convivium.

"Effect of amidated alginate on faecal lipids, serum and hepatic cholesterol in rats fed diets supplemented with fat and cholesterol","The effect of octadecylamide of alginic acid on serum and hepatic cholesterol, and the faecal output of fat and sterols was examined in female rats fed diets containing cholesterol and palm fat at 10 and 50 g kg−1, respectively. Cholesterol supplementation significantly increased serum and hepatic cholesterol concentrations, and faecal output of cholesterol and coprostanol. Cholesterol and amidated alginate supplementations changed the profile of fatty acids in the faeces. Cholesterol increased molar percentages of saturated fatty acids and amidated alginate reversed this effect. Amidated alginate, supplied at 10, 20 and 40 g kg−1, significantly decreased serum cholesterol from 2.82 to 2.00, 1.95, and 1.63 μmol mL−1, respectively, and significantly decreased hepatic cholesterol from 13.8 to 9.33, 7.81 and 6.3 μmol g−1, respectively. Amidated alginate increased the faecal output of fat and neutral sterols in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the output of bile acids was significantly decreased. The faecal outputs of fat and serum cholesterol were negatively correlated. At the highest concentration tested, amidated alginate significantly reduced the serum concentration of triacylglycerols. It can be concluded that amidated alginate is an effective cholesterol-lowering agent and sorbent of dietary fat.",10608.0,"Marounek, Milan:Volek, Zdeněk:Taubner, Tomáš:Dušková, Dagmar:Čermák, Ladislav",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
"Characterizing the uppermost 100 m structure of the San Jacinto fault zone southeast of Anza, California, through joint analysis of geological, topographic, seismic and resistivity data","We present results from complementary geological, topographic, seismic and electrical resistivity surveys at the Sagebrush Flat (SGB) site along the Clark fault (CF) strand of the San Jacinto fault zone trifurcation area southeast of Anza, California. Joint interpretation of these data sets, each with unique spatiotemporal sensitivities, allow us to better characterize the shallow (<100 m) fault zone at this structurally complex site. Geological mapping at the surface shows the CF has three main subparallel strands within a <100 m zone with varying degrees of rock damage. These strands intersect units of banded gneiss and tonalite, and various sedimentary units. Near the surface, the weathered but more intact tonalite and gneiss to the southwest have relatively high V-P. The low-lying flat sedimentary basins around the two southwestern-most CF strands and elevated damaged gneiss to the northeast have lowest V-P <500 m s(-1). The high relief of the northeast gneiss unit may in part be explained by its extensive damage and inferred increased relative rock uplift. Resistivity imaging shows the unconsolidated dry basin sediments (maximum >1300 Ohm.m) contrasted against the compacted fine-grained (potentially wet) materials within the CF core and the Bautista Formation (minimum <40 Ohm.m), which is slightly elevated above the flat basins. The inverse relationship between VP (increases) and resistivity (decreases) in the uppermost similar to 15 m can be characterized as log-log linear with slopes of -2.6 to -4. At depths >30 m, the velocity heterogeneity near the surface merges into larger-scale structures that are generally slower on the northeast side of the CF core compared to the southwest side (as much as similar to 40 per cent reduction in average V-P). A previous study revealed a 20-37 per cent variability in peak ground velocities across the SGB site from local earthquakes. The upper end of that range is associated with the near-surface unconsolidated sedimentary basins and northeast damaged gneiss unit. Preliminary analysis of time-dependent topography mostly shows effects of changing vegetation and anthropogenic activity.",10505.0,"Share, P.E.:Tábořík, Petr:Štěpančíková, Petra:Stemberk, Jakub:Rockwell, Thomas:Wade, A.:Arrowsmith, J.R.:Donnellan, A.:Vernon, F.L.:Ben-Zion, Y.",Geophysical Journal International,3,low,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ten years of VINQUEST: first insight for breeding new apple,"Apple scab, caused by Venturia inaequalis, is a major disease worldwide. To control this disease, up to 20–25 fungicide applications may be needed depending on the year and the production system. Breeding for durable scab resistance is an objective of most apple breeding programmes. Cultivation of apple scab-resistant cultivars would reduce the chemical footprint of apple production. One way to achieve durable resistance is to pyramid multiple apple scab resistance genes in a cultivar. Currently, more than 18 different apple scab resistance genes have been reported. Molecular markers are available for most of them and can be used to select seedlings carrying multiple resistance genes. However, one key question remains to be answered: which genes should be chosen to create durable resistance? Unfortunately, very little is known on the presence and geographical distribution of apple scab isolates virulent to specific apple scab resistance genes. In order to fill this knowledge gap, the VINQUEST project (www.vinquest.ch) was initiated in 2009. Ten years after the launch of this initiative, 24 partners from 14 countries are regularly contributing data. Results obtained from the data collected during the first 10 years allowed us to have first insights into which apple scab resistance genes may hold most promise for breeding cultivars with durable resistances. Apple breeders will be able to make informed choices about combining scab resistance genes based on the virulences present in the regional V. inaequalis populations.",40106.0,"Vávra, Radek:Patocchi, A.:Wehrli, A.:Dubuis, W.:Auwerkerken, A.:Leida, L.:Cipriani, G.:Passey, G.:Staples, M.:Didelot, F.:Philion, V.:Peil, A.:Laszakovits, H.:Rühmer, T.:Boeck, K.:Baniulis, D.:Strasser, K.:Guerra, W.:Masny, L.:Ruess, F.:Le Berre, F.:Nybom, H.:Tartarini, S.:Spornberger, A.:Pikunova, A.:Bus, V.",Plant Disease,3,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Quality Assessment of Sharpened Images: Challenges, Methodology, and Objective Metrics","Most of the effort in image quality assessment (QA) has been so far dedicated to the degradation of the image. However, there are also many algorithms in the image processing chain that can enhance the quality of an input image. These include procedures for contrast enhancement, deblurring, sharpening, up-sampling, denoising, transfer function compensation, and so on. In this paper, possible strategies for the QA of sharpened images are investigated. This task is not trivial, because the sharpening techniques can increase the perceived quality, as well as introduce artifacts leading to the quality drop (over-sharpening). Here, the framework specifically adapted for the QA of sharpened images and objective metrics comparison in this context is introduced. However, the framework can be adopted in other QA areas as well. The problem of selecting the correct procedure for subjective evaluation was addressed and a subjective test on blurred, sharpened, and over-sharpened images was performed in order to demonstrate the use of the framework. The obtained ground-truth data were used for testing the suitability of the state-of-the-art objective quality metrics for the assessment of sharpened images. The comparison was performed by novel procedure using rank order correlation analyses, which is found more appropriate for the task than standard methods. Furthermore, seven possible augmentations of the no-reference S3 metric adapted for sharpened images are proposed. The performance of the metric is significantly improved and also superior over the rest of the tested quality criteria with respect to the subjective data.",20201.0,"Krasula, Lukáš:Le Callet, P.:Fliegel, Karel:Klíma, Miloš",IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,3,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Carbogels: carbonized conducting polyaniline/poly(vinyl alcohol) aerogels derived from cryogels for electrochemical capacitors,"Polyaniline cryogels supported with poly(vinyl alcohol) represent soft conducting macroporous materials suitable for conversion to aerogels by freeze-drying and, subsequently, to nitrogen-containing carbogels by carbonization in an inert atmosphere at 500–600 °C. The process was followed by thermogravimetric analysis and Raman spectroscopy at the molecular level. The spectral features indicate a significant degree of structural disorder in the material due to the extensive nitrogen and oxygen incorporation into the carbon sp2 network, which is important for the improvement of capacitive performance. The macroporous morphology is preserved after carbonization but the specific surface area increased from 12 to 680 m2 g−1 after exposure to 500 °C in an inert atmosphere. The original conductivity of the cryogel swollen with an acid solution, 0.07 S cm−1, was reduced to 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 for the aerogel and again to 10−9 S cm−1 as the carbonization progressed. The impedance spectra display Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars relaxation typical of heterogeneous composite systems with the contribution of ionic conductivity. The decrease in conductivity is in agreement with the significant drop in the static dielectric constant observed by broad-band dielectric spectroscopy and decrease in the spin number determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Switching in the capacitive response from that dominated by faradaic surface processes at lower treatment temperatures to that of double-layer charging at elevated temperatures is evidenced, while the correlation between surface spin density and specific capacitance is emphasized.

Between fraternal help and economic realism. The employment of Polish workers in Czechoslovakia 1945–1950,"The paper deals with the topic of the employment of the Polish workers in post- -war Czechoslovakia. Analysed are mainly the features of the Czechoslovak workforce policy with some insight into the political context of the Czechoslovak-Polish relations. Despite the tensions, the employment of Polish citizens in Czechoslovak coal mines continued after the war in line with the laws of supply and demand. The advantages of the temporary border crossing, were enjoyed and quietly tolerated by both parties. First, with the start of the five- and six-year Plans in both countries, this development conformed with the demands of the centrally directed policy for the distribution of workforce stemming from a planned economy. From its very beginning, recruitment of Polish agricultural workers represented a method employed by the government in its attempt to cope with the permanent shortage of workers in the post-war Czechoslovak labour market. Just like the other emergency measures, it was accompanied by disproportions in economic costs. The influence of political symbols which were detrimental to the economy were also among the specific attributes of this arrangements. The development in both cases reveals a change in the economic as well as political thinking on the threshold of the communist rule.",60101.0,"Dvořák, Tomáš",Historia Slavorum Occidentis,3,low,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Full-scale experimental testing of the blast resistance of HPFRC and UHPFRC bridge decks,"Because of the current geopolitical situation, research on improving the resistance of the civil and transport infrastructure to blast or impact loads has gained considerable attention in recent years. This paper presents the results of full-scale blast experiments designed to characterize the resistance of steel-ﬁber reinforced concrete full-scale bridge decks subjected to near-ﬁeld blast loading, and its dependence on the material properties of the concrete. The blast performance of reinforced concrete specimens increases with added high-performance steel ﬁbers. An increase in ﬁber content and in compressive strength up to ultrahigh-performance ﬁber concrete (UHPFRC) further enhances its blast performance. An attempt was made to further increase the blast resistance of a concrete structure with the use of a basalt mesh. The UHPFRC specimen with a basalt mesh experienced a greater extent of internal damage than a regular UHPFRC specimen. However, the basalt mesh inserted into the concrete cover at the sofﬁt of the UHPFRC specimen improved its blast performance, as expressed by the area of spalling and the volume of debris. This phenomenon was studied numerically, and it was proved that it is caused by the internal rebound of the shock wave, which causes a local increase in the stresses inside the specimen. The heterogeneity of the specimens, which is increased by an internal reinforcement or by a basalt mesh, converts the blast damage due to internal rebounds into layer delamination. The delamination of the concrete specimen can be very effective in dissipating the energy of the blast wave.",20102.0,"Foglar, Marek:Hájek, Radek:Fládr, Josef:Pachman, J.:Štoller, J.",Construction and Building Materials,3,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Grassland restoration on ex-arable land by transfer of brush-harvested propagules and green hay,"Effective restoration of meadows requires seeds of local provenance to preserve not only the species diversity but also the genetic identity of plant communities. We compared three different methods of seed harvesting from local meadow communities and assessed their efficiency in meadow restoration on ex-arable land. These methods were: brush harvesting once only, brush harvesting three times during a season, and green hay transfer. We observed the composition of species and functional traits of seed source meadows, sampled the three harvested seed mixtures and monitored plant communities restored on ex-arable land with this seed over the five following years. Green hay transfer was the method producing the highest amount of seeds (expressed as mass) and the highest number of species per unit of source-meadow area, followed by brush harvesting three times during one season and once only, respectively. This resulted in the highest establishment rate of species on ex-arable land in the green hay transfer method, followed by brush harvesting three times during one season and once only, respectively. Across all methods, species abundant in the seed mixture, having a low specific leaf area and a low capacity for lateral clonal spread, were the most successfully harvested and established ones. In the restored communities, mainly species number and cover of legumes but also of target meadow species increased with time, while ruderal weedy species decreased. Concerning species number and composition as well as trait spectrum, green hay transfer was the most successful method of restoration, resulting in a community most similar to the seed source meadow.",10618.0,"Ševčíková, Magdalena:Frei, Ivana:Albert, Ágnes-Júlia:Mudrák, Ondřej:Jongepierová, Ivana:Fajmon, Karel:Klimešová, Jitka:Doležal, Jiří","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management and avoidance of adverse events of treatment in chronic myeloid leukaemia,"Most reports on chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) focus on efficacy, particularly on molecular response and outcome. In contrast, adverse events (AEs) are often reported as infrequent, minor, tolerable and manageable, but they are increasingly important as therapy is potentially lifelong and multiple TKIs are available. For this reason, the European LeukemiaNet panel for CML management recommendations presents an exhaustive and critical summary of AEs emerging during CML treatment, to assist their understanding, management and prevention. There are five major conclusions. First, the main purpose of CML treatment is the antileukemic effect. Suboptimal management of AEs must not compromise this first objective.

Characterization of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase from Brassica and Lactuca spp. and its modulation during plant development,"Cellular homeostasis of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a major cache of nitric oxide bioactivity in plants, is controlled by the NADH-dependent S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) belonging to the family of class III alcohol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.1). GSNOR is a key regulator of S-nitrosothiol metabolism and is involved in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. This study was focused on GSNOR from two important crop plants, cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis, BoGSNOR) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa, LsGSNOR). Both purified recombinant GSNORs were characterized in vitro and found to exists as dimers, exhibit high thermal stability and substrate preference towards GSNO, although both enzymes have dehydrogenase activity with a broad range of long-chain alcohols and ω-hydroxy fatty acids in presence of NAD+. Data on enzyme affinities to their cofactors NADH and NAD+ obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry suggest the high affinity to NADH might underline the GSNOR capacity to function in the intracellular environment. GSNOR activity and gene expression peak during early developmental stages of lettuce and cauliflower at 20 and 30 days after germination, respectively. GSNOR activity was also measured in four other Lactuca spp. genotypes with different degree of resistance to biotrophic pathogen Bremia lactucae. Higher GSNOR activities were found in non-infected plants of susceptible genotypes L. sativa UCDM2 and L. serriola as compared to resistant genotypes. GSNOR and GSNO were localized by confocal laser scanning microscopy in vascular bundles and in epidermal and parenchymal cells of leaf cross-sections.

Identification of furan fatty acids in the lipids of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.),"Fatty acid (FA) composition was analyzed in muscle and gonad tissues of marketed common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The extracted lipids were separated into four fractions: polar lipids (PL), diacylglycerols, free fatty acids and triacylglycerols (TAG) using thin layer chromatography. FA content within the lipid fractions was determined by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC/FID). The muscle lipids consisted primarily of TAG (96.9% of total FA), while PL were the major component of both male (67.6%) and female gonad (58.6%) lipids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids predominated in PL of all tissues (52.2-55.8% of total FA), monounsaturated fatty acids were the most abundant FA group in TAG of muscle (51.8%) and female gonads (47.8%) whereas high proportion of furan fatty acids (F-acids) (38.2%) was detected in TAG of male gonads.

Biomechanical Characterization of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes by Use of Atomic Force Microscopy,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is not only a high-resolution imaging technique but also a sensitive tool able to study biomechanical properties of bio-samples (biomolecules, cells) in native conditions—i.e., in buffered solutions (culturing media) and stable temperature (mostly 37 °C). Micromechanical transducers (cantilevers) are often used to map surface stiffness distribution, adhesion forces, and viscoelastic parameters of living cells, however, they can also be used to monitor time course of cardiomyocytes contraction dynamics (e.g. beating rate, relaxation time), together with other biomechanical properties. Here we describe the construction of an AFM-based biosensor setup designed to study the biomechanical properties of cardiomyocyte clusters, through the use of standard uncoated silicon nitride cantilevers. Force-time curves (mechanocardiograms, MCG) are recorded continuously in real time and in the presence of cardiomyocyte-contraction affecting drugs (e.g., isoproterenol, metoprolol) in the medium, under physiological conditions. The average value of contraction force and the beat rate, as basic biomechanical parameters, represent pharmacological indicators of different phenotype features.

Real-Time Visualization of Cell Membrane Damage Using Gadolinium-Schiff Base Complex-Doped Quantum Dots,"Despite the importance of cell membranes for maintenance of integrity of cellular structures, there is still a lack of methods that allow simple real-time visualization of their damage. Herein, we describe gadolinium-Schiff base-doped quantum dots (GdQDs)-based probes for a fast facile spatial labeling of membrane injuries. We found that GdQDs preferentially interact through electron-rich and hydrophobic residues with a specific sequence motif of NHE-RF2 scaffold protein, exposed upon membrane damage. Such interaction results in a fast formation of intensively fluorescent droplets with a higher resolution and in a much shorter time compared to immunofluorescence using organic dye. GdQDs have high stability, brightness, and considerable cytocompatibility, which enable their use in long-term experiments in living cultures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report, demonstrating a method allowing real-time monitoring of membrane damage and recovery without any special requirements for instrumentation. Because of intensive brightness and simple signal pattern, GdQDs allow easy examination of interactions between cellular membranes and cell-penetrating peptides or cytostatic drugs.

Spatiotemporal magnetic fields enhance cytosolic Ca2+ levels and induce actin polymerization via activation of voltage-gated sodium channels in skeletal muscle cells,"Cellular function is modulated by the electric membrane potential controlling intracellular physiology and signal propagation from a motor neuron to a muscle fiber resulting in muscle contraction. Unlike electric fields, magnetic fields are not attenuated by biological materials and penetrate deep into the tissue. We used complex spatiotemporal magnetic fields (17-70 mT) to control intracellular signaling in skeletal muscle cells. By changing different parameters of the alternating magnetic field (amplitude, inversion time, rotation frequency), we induced transient depolarization of cellular membranes leading to i) Na+ influx through voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC), ii) cytosolic calcium increase, and iii) VGSC- and ryanodine receptor-dependent increase of actin polymerization.

Lateral Dynamics of Walking-Like Mechanical Systems and Their Chaotic Behavior,"A detailed mathematical analysis of the two-dimensional hybrid model for the lateral dynamics of walking-like mechanical systems (the so-called hybrid inverted pendulum) is presented in this article. The chaotic behavior, when being externally harmonically perturbed, is demonstrated. Two rather exceptional features are analyzed. Firstly, the unperturbed undamped hybrid inverted pendulum behaves inside a certain stability region periodically and its respective frequencies range from zero (close to the boundary of that stability region) to infinity (close to its double support equilibrium). Secondly, the constant lateral forcing less than a certain threshold does not affect the periodic behavior of the hybrid inverted pendulum and preserves its equilibrium at the origin. The latter is due to the hybrid nature of the equilibrium at the origin, which exists only in the Filippov sense. It is actually a trivial example of the so-called pseudo-equilibrium [Kuznetsov et al., 2003]. Nevertheless, such an observation holds only for constant external forcing and even arbitrary small time-varying external forcing may destabilize the origin. As a matter of fact, one can observe many, possibly even infinitely many, distinct chaotic attractors for a single system when the forcing amplitude does not exceed the mentioned threshold. Moreover, some general properties of the hybrid inverted pendulum are characterized through its topological equivalence to the classical pendulum. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the chaotic behavior of the harmonically perturbed hybrid inverted pendulum.",20204.0,"Čelikovský, Sergej:Lynnyk, Volodymyr",International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,3,medium,high,1,1,high,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The long-term effect of continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions on camptocormia in Parkinson's disease,"Camptocormia is defined as an involuntary marked flexion of the thoracolumbar spine, which develops while standing, walking, or sitting and disappears in the supine position. The reported prevalence rates in Parkinson's disease (PD) range from 3% to 17%. Camptocormia significantly affects the quality of life of patients. Unlike other symptoms of PD, manipulation with oral dopaminergic therapy, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and paravertebral botulinum toxin injections provide only limited benefits [1].

New Model of Ventral Spinal Cord Lesion Induced by Balloon Compression in Rats,"Despite the variety of experimental models of spinal cord injury (SCI) currently used, the model of the ventral compression cord injury, which is commonly seen in humans, is very limited. Ventral balloon compression injury reflects the common anatomical mechanism of a human lesion and has the advantage of grading the injury severity by controlling the inflated volume of the balloon. In this study, ventral compression of the SCI was performed by the anterior epidural placement of the balloon of a 2F Fogarty&apos,s catheter, via laminectomy, at the level of T10. The balloon was rapidly inflated with 10 or 15 μL of saline and rested in situ for 5 min. The severity of the lesion was assessed by behavioral and immunohistochemical tests. Compression with the volume of 15 μL resulted in severe motor and sensory deficits represented by the complete inability to move across a horizontal ladder, a final Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) score of 7.4 and a decreased withdrawal time in the plantar test (11.6 s). Histology and immunohistochemistry revealed a significant loss of white and gray matter with a loss of motoneuron, and an increased size of astrogliosis. An inflation volume of 10 μL resulted in a mild transient deficit. There are no other balloon compression models of ventral spinal cord injury. This study provided and validated a novel, easily replicable model of the ventral compression SCI, introduced by an inflated balloon of Fogarty&apos,s catheter. For a severe incomplete deficit, an inflated volume should be maintained at 15 μL.",30103.0,"Krůpa, Petr:Štěpánková, Kateřina:Kwok, Jessica Cf:Fawcett, James W:Cimermanova, Veronika:Jendelová, Pavla:Machová Urdzíková, Lucia",Biomedicines [online],3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lightweight blended building waste in the production of innovative cement-based composites for sustainable construction,"Intensive quarrying of natural non-renewable resources belongs to the actual topics related to the dynamically developing construction industry worldwide. However, at the same moment, an appreciable quantity of construction and demolition waste (CDW) is generated. Some of them are already applied in concrete manufacturing as supplementing and filling materials. Nevertheless, a number of material blends which separation is complicated or highly financial demanding still remain and thus burden our environment. This work has been aimed at the effective application of lightweight blended building waste (LBW) in the manufacturing of eco-friendly concretes.

Active flow separation control at the outer wing,"Within the European project AFLoNext, one of the technological streams is dedicated to the investigation of active flow control (AFC) to increase the robustness of the wing tip design at takeoff conditions, whilst allowing the optimization of aerodynamic efficiency in cruise. AFC is used to delay the wing tip stall, which is caused by vortex breakdown, thus improving the lift to drag ratio and allowing a steeper climb gradient during second segment climb when the landing gear is retracted. The numerical parametric studies of AFC aerodynamic sizing were shared between the involved partners on the basis of actuator location (in the leading edge region or on the upper surface) and actuator types (steady blowing, synthetic jets, pulsed jets). Most of the numerical results have been obtained for steady blowing through continuous or segmented slots. The specific effect of the unsteady means of actuation on the flow topology was also identified. The aim of this study was to take into account industrial requirements defined by Airbus and geometric constraints of AFC actuators arising from the project partners involved in the development of AFC hardware. Some comparisons between the partners’ results are presented, allowing preliminary conclusions to be drawn.

Creep behavior of AJ62 Magnesium–Aluminum–Strontium alloy,"Creep tests were conducted in uniaxial compression to evaluate the creep behavior of magnesium–aluminum–strontium alloy at temperaturesnfrom 373 to 673 K. Stress dependencies of the creep rate over the whole interval of temperatures and stresses can be well describednphenomenologically by the Garofalo sine hyperbolic equation modified by the inclusion of a threshold stress. The threshold stress increasesnwith decreasing temperature. Creep data normalized by a diffusion coefficient and shear modulus clearly reveal the existence of two differentnregions. Possible mechanisms by which plastic deformation takes place have been identified in both regions. The critical stress at whichndislocations break away from the cloud of foreign atoms agrees well with the value determined by data normalization. At low stresses, anvalue of the stress exponent is consistent with the model of deformation that takes place through dislocation glide controlled byndragging of solute atoms. At high stresses, the multiple regression yields the activation energy which agrees with that for prismatic glide.",20501.0,"Dobeš, Ferdinand:Dymáček, Petr",Journal of Magnesium and Alloys,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Metabolism of sulfur compounds in homocystinurias,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Homocystinurias are rare genetic defects characterized by altered fluxes of sulfur compounds including homocysteine and cysteine. We explored whether the severely perturbed sulfur amino acid metabolism in patients with homocystinurias affects the metabolism of hydrogen sulfide. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We studied 10 treated patients with a block in the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (CBSD) and six treated patients with remethylation defects (RMD) and an enhanced flux of sulfur metabolites via transsulfuration. Control groups for CBSD and RMD patients consisted of 22 patients with phenylketonuria on a low-protein diet and of 12 healthy controls respectively. Plasma and urine concentrations of selected sulfur compounds were analysed by HPLC and LC-MS/MS. KEY RESULTS: Patients with CBSD exhibited plasma concentrations of monobromobimane-detected sulfide similar to appropriate controls. Urinary homolanthionine and thiosulfate in CBSD were increased significantly 1.9 and 3 times suggesting higher hydrogen sulfide synthesis by gamma-cystathionase and detoxification respectively. Surprisingly, patients with RMD had significantly lower plasma sulfide levels (53 and 64% of controls) with lower sulfite concentrations, and higher taurine and thiosulfate levels suggesting enhanced cysteine oxidation and hydrogen sulfide catabolism respectively. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The results from this study suggest that severe inherited defects in sulfur amino acid metabolism may be accompanied by only moderately perturbed hydrogen sulfide metabolism and lends support to the hypothesis that enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway may not be the major contributors to the endogenous hydrogen sulfide pool.",30202.0,"Kožich, Viktor:Ditrói, Tamás:Sokolová, Jitka:Křížková, Michaela:Krijt, Jakub:Ješina, Pavel:Nagy, Peter",British Journal of Pharmacology,3,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cyclosporine A promotes the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells on transplantation reaction,"The successful application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains a major challenge in stem cell therapy. Currently, several in vitro studies have indicated potentially beneficial interactions of MSCs with immunosuppressive drugs. These interactions can be even more complex in vivo, and it is in this setting that we investigate the effect of MSCs in combination with Cyclosporine A (CsA) on transplantation reaction and allogeneic cell survival. Using an in vivo mouse model, we found that CsA significantly promoted the survival of MSCs in various organs and tissues of the recipients. In addition, compared to treatment with CsA or MSCs alone, the survival of transplanted allogeneic cells was significantly improved after the combined application of MSCs with CsA. We further observed that the combinatory treatment suppressed immune response to the alloantigen challenge and modulated the immune balance by harnessing proinflammatory CD4+T-bet+ and CD4+RORγt+ cell subsets. These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in IL-17 production along with an elevated level of IL-10. Co-cultivation of purified naive CD4+ cells with peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice treated with MSCs and CsA revealed that MSC-educated macrophages play an important role in the immunomodulatory effect observed on distinct T-cell subpopulations. Taken together, our findings suggest that CsA promotes MSC survival in vivo and that the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of MSCs with CsA is superior to each monotherapy. This combinatory treatment thus represents a promising approach to reducing immunosuppressant dosage while maintaining or even improving the outcome of therapy.",30213.0,"Hájková, Michaela:Jabůrek, F.:Porubská, Bianka:Boháčová, Pavla:Holáň, Vladimír:Krulová, Magdaléna",Clinical Science,3,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

PY release after soil exhumation followed by experimental laboratory germination of remaining dormant seeds (wet, 25 C, 21 days) were related to the environmental conditions of the common garden and macroclimatic variables of the site of origin of the accessions. Higher PY release was observed in buried seeds under humid rather than under dry and hot environments. Wild pea showed higher phenotypic plasticity on PY release than barrel medic, which had higher bet-hedging within-season. Wild pea showed lower bet-hedging among-season (PY &lt, 10%) in relation to precipitation than barrel medic, which was more conservative (PY 20%).

Enhanced gas separation performance of 6FDA-DAM based mixed matrix membranes by incorporating MOF UiO-66 and its derivatives,"Functionalization and post-synthetic modification (PSM) of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are two important routes to obtain MOFs with full potential in mixed matrix membrane (MMM) fabrication. We synthesized UiO-66 and two derivatives UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH-COCH3 with less than 50 nm particle size. The CO2 uptakes at 10 bar in the two functionalized UiO-66s were improved by 44% and 58%, respectively, with respect to the pristine solid. The MOF nanoparticles were incorporated into the highly permeable polymer 6FDA-DAM, making MMMs with 5-24 wt% particle loadings. All fillers and membranes were characterized accordingly, and their gas separation performances were evaluated by feeding CO2/CH4 equimolar mixtures at 2 bar pressure difference at 35 °C. CO2 permeability (PCO2) of pristine 6FDA-DAM (PCO2 = 997 ± 48 Barrer, αCO2/CH4 = 29 ± 3) increased by 92% with 20 wt% UiO-66 loading, while maintaining the CO2/CH4 selectivity. Improvements of 23% and 27% were observed for PCO2 with the same 20 wt% loading of UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH-COCH3, respectively. The αCO2/CH4 was improved up to 16% using both functionalized UiO-66 type MOFs. The best separation performance in this work was obtained with 14 wt% UiO-66 MMM (PCO2 = 1912 ± 115 Barrer, αCO2/CH4 = 31 ± 1), 16 wt% UiO-66-NH2 MMM (PCO2 = 1223 ± 23 Barrer, αCO2/CH4 = 30 ± 1) and 16 wt% UiO-66-NH-COCH3 MMM (PCO2 = 1263 ± 42 Barrer, αCO2/CH4 = 33 ± 1) at 2 bar feed pressure difference. The measurement was also conducted with various binary compositions (CO2 = 10 - 90%), both at low and high pressures up to 40 bar at 35 °C, showing no pressure-related CO2-induced plasticization. The atomistic modelling for the MOF/polymer interface was consistent with a moderate MOF surface coverage by 6FDA-DAM which did not play a detrimental role in the membrane performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",20402.0,"Ahmad, Mohd Zamidi:Navarro, M.:Lhotka, Miloslav:Zornoza, B.:Téllez, C.:de, Vos W.M.:Benes, N.E.:Konnertz, N.M.:Visser, T.:Semino, R.:Maurin, G.:Fíla, Vlastimil:Coronas, J.",Journal of Membrane Science,3,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1

Numerical Comparison of Prediction Models for Aerosol Filtration Efficiency Applied on a Hollow-Fiber Membrane Pore Structure,"Hollow-fiber membranes (HFMs) have widely been applied to many liquid treatment applications such as wastewater treatment, membrane contactors/bioreactors, membrane distillation etc. Despite the fact that HFMs are widely used for gas separation from gas mixtures, their use for mechanical filtration of aerosols is very scarce. In this work, we compared mathematical models developed for prediction of air filtration efficiency applying them on the structural parameters of polypropylene HFMs. These membranes are characteristic of pore diameters of about 90 nm and high solidity, thus high potential for nanoparticle removal from air. Single fiber/collector and capillary pore approach were chosen to compare between models developed for fibrous filters and capillary-pore membranes (Nuclepore filters) based on three main mechanisms occurring in aerosol filtration (inertial impaction, interception and diffusion). The collection efficiency due to individual mechanisms differs significantly. The differences are caused by the parameters for which the individual models were developed, i.e. given values of governing dimensionless numbers (Reynolds, Stokes and Peclet number) and also given values of filter porosity and filter fiber diameter. Some models can be used to predict the efficiency of HFMs based on assumptions depending on the conditions and exact membrane parameters.",21002.0,"Bulejko, Pavel",Nanomaterials,3,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dielectric properties and vacancy-like defects in plasma-sprayed barium titanate.,"Positron annihilation spectroscopy was employed for investigation of vacancy-like defects in plasma-sprayed barium titanate. Defect studies were combined with measurement of dielectric properties of barium titanate coatings. Samples prepared by gas-stabilized plasma spray (GSP) torch and by plasma torch with the hybrid water-argon stabilization (WSP-H) were studied. Processing parameters were selected so that GSP coatings were sprayed in reductive conditions, whereas WSP-H coatings were prepared in oxidizing environment. As-sprayed GSP coating is dark, whereas WSP-H one is light. The dielectric properties of WSP-H coating are superior to those for GSP one. Defect studies revealed that both GSP and WSP-H coatings contain titanium vacancies. However, GSP coating contains in addition a considerable concentration of oxygen vacancies. Some fraction of oxygen vacancies in GSP coating is coupled with titanium vacancies forming partial Schottky defect. The structure of WSP-H coating is less disordered and contains only a low concentration of oxygen vacancies. This is consistent with reductive and oxidizing conditions in GSP and WSP-H spraying, respectively.Annealing at elevated temperatures in air leads to removal of oxygen vacancies which are filled by oxygen diffusing into the samples.",20504.0,"Ctibor, Pavel:Čížek, J.:Sedláček, J.:Lukáč, František",Journal of the American Ceramic Society,3,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The formation of forced folds and wing-like sand intrusions driven by pore fluid overpressure: Implications from 2D experimental modeling,"Sand injections form by intrusion of overpressured, fluidized sand into surrounding low-permeable, fine-grained rocks. Modern 3-D seismic data revealed their abundant occurrence in many sedimentary basins and that their intrusion is typically associated with forced folding and tensile fractures of the sealing cover layer. In order to investigate the kinematic evolution of forced folds in relation to the associated propagation of fractures originating from an overpressured source layer, we performed idealized, quasi-2-D analog experiments. The models consist of noncohesive and cohesive granulates to mimic a sand reservoir and its overburden layer and injected air to produce fluid overpressure in the layered materials. Our results show that forced folding first induces tensile bending fractures at the base of the fold limbs at a certain critical fluid pressure. Due to further increase of the fluid pressure, the apex of these bending fractures serves as origin for branching, conical fractures characterized by shear and tensile failure. Fracture breakthrough is accompanied by a rapid uplift of the breached fold limb and a pressure drop in the reservoir layer followed by a continuous subsidence of the central forced fold. The morphology of the fracture pattern and the forced fold provides helpful implications for understanding formation processes of natural sand injections observed in seismic data and in outcrops.",10505.0,"Warsitzka, Michael:Kukowski, N.:May, F.",Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth,3,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Evolving Private Labor Markets and the (Non-) Acquisition of Language,"Extensive language training is not typically provided to immigrant manual laborers, as it is presumed unnecessary for their jobs. Such a tendency may further deepen these laborers’ social and economic disadvantages. This study examines the changing situation of Vietnamese workers in the Czech Republic (CR) in this regard. It maps the organization of their employment over several decades, considering the historical-economic context and its influences on access to language education, and subsequently, potential for further mobility. The professional trajectories of several individual (former or current) workers are explored, highlighting conditions and processes that are often beyond their control. The analysis suggests that given these individuals’ situations, Czech state language policy, consisting of an exam for permanent residence after five years, is an insufficient remedy to the language and communicative problems many first-generation immigrant workers face.",60203.0,"Sherman, Tamah:Homoláč, Jiří","Language, Global Mobilities, Blue-collar Workers And Blue-collar Workplaces",3,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tailoring of carbonized polypyrrole nanotubes core by different polypyrrole shells for oxygen reduction reaction selectivity modification,"By using methyl orange template, polypyrrole nanotubes were obtained by the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole. The nanotubes were carbonized in inert atmosphere to nitrogen-enriched carbon nanotubes. These were subsequently coated with 20 wt% of polypyrrole prepared in the absence or the presence of anionic dyes (methyl orange or Acid Blue 25). The morphology of all the samples was examined by the electron microscopies, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental analysis were used to prove the chemical structure and the successful coating process. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis was used to calculate the spin concentrations. Significant impact of coating method is evidenced with neat polypyrrole coating providing a two-fold capacitance increase compared to uncoated nanotubes, while coating in the presence of Acid Blue 25 decreasing it slightly. With respect to oxygen reduction reaction, coatings irreversibly transformed in the first few cycles in the presence of the products of O2 reduction, presumably hydrogen peroxide, altering the oxygen reduction mechanism. This transformation allows the tailoring of the polymeric shell, over ORR active carbonaceous core, and tuning of the catalyst selectivity and optimization of materials performance for a given application – from alkaline fuel cells to hydrogen peroxide generation.",20505.0,"Minisy, Islam M.:Gavrilov, N.:Acharya, Udit:Morávková, Zuzana:Unterweger, C.:Mičušík, M.:Filippov, Sergey K.:Kredatusová, Jana:Pašti, I.

Radical and moderate left activism in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia (1989–2010),"The chapter draws on the data on protest events organized by moderate and radical left organizations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia between 1989 and 2010, and deals with two main issues. First, it reviews the main approaches to the definition of radical left politics, identifies how it may be differentiated from the activities of the reformist (old) Left and from the post-modernist strategies of the new social movements, and illustrates this empirically. The chapter shows that the key aspects of radical left activism (post-materialist issues, confrontational repertoire, sub-national and supra-national scale of claims) demarcate it from the moderate left contention also in the post-communist context. Second, the paper focuses on the role of political context of activism. It follows Kriesi´s notion of political opportunity structure and focuses on the role of political cleavages in shaping political activism. More specifically, the chapter explores how the salience of socio-economic conflict influences protest agenda, general cooperation patterns, and reactions to national cabinet shifts in two countries under study. Chapter comes to conclusion that while there are systematic differences in terms of protest cooperation and reactions towards the orientation of national cabinet, there are only minor differences in terms of protest issue preference.",50601.0,"Navrátil, Jiří",Radical Left Movements in Europe,3,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons by using photodeposited Pt nanoparticles on carbon-doped titania,"Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O was performed in a top-irradiation stainless-steel photoreactor with Pt/C-TiO2 as the photocatalyst. Pt/C-TiO2 photocatalysts with different amount of Pt (0.5-3.0 wt.%) were synthesized by the photodeposition method and were characterized in detail by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), nitrogen physisorption measurement (BET), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and photoelectrochemical measurements. Results revealed the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 increased by loading Pt on the surface of C-TiO2. The main reaction product was methane (CH4), however, hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were also detected. The highest yields of CH4, H2, and CO were achieved in the presence Pt/C-TiO2 with a nominal loading of 0.88 wt.%, resulting from the efficient interfacial transfer of photogenerated electrons from C-TiO2 to Pt as it is evidenced from photoelectochemical measurements.",10400.0,"Tasbihi, Minoo:Schwarze, Michael:Edelmannová, Miroslava:Spöri, Camillo:Strasser, Peter:Schomäcker, Reinhald",Catalysis Today,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Size determination of microbubbles in optical microscopy: a best-case scenario,"Microbubble-based ultrasound contrast agents are used in clinical settings to enhance backscattered ultrasound signals from blood during perfusion and blood flow measurements. The dynamics of microbubbles contained in ultrasound contrast agents are typically studied with a high-speed camera attached to a microscope. Such microbubbles, with resting diameters between 1 µm and 7 µm, are considered in optical focus if the bubble centers are in the focal plane of the objective lens. Nonetheless, when a three-dimensional object, a stack of infinitely thin two-dimensional layers, is imaged through a microscope, the image formed onto the charge coupled device element consists of contributions from all layers. If a bubble is larger than the depth of focus, the part of the bubble above the focal plane influences the image formation and therefore the bubble size measured. If a bubble is of a size in the order of the wavelengths of the light used, the system resolution and the segmentation method influence the bubble size measured. In this study, the projections of three dimensional microbubbles (hollow spheres) were computed with an ideal, weighted three-dimensional point spread function to find out under which circumstances the optical image formation leads to a significant deviation in measurement of the actual size. The artificial images were subjected to segmentation techniques for objectively comparing original microbubble sizes with measured microbubble sizes. Results showed that a systematic error was observed for objects in focus with radius ≤ 1.65µm. Also it was concluded that even though a three-dimensional object is in focus, there is discrepancy of up to 0.66% in size measurement. In addition, size measurement of an object for the same shift above and below focus could differ by up to 3.6%. Moreover, defocusing above 25% severely deviates size measurements while defocusing up to 90% could result in mean percentage error of up to 67.96.",10201.0,"Postema, Michiel:Abraham, Habtamu:Krejcar, Ondřej:Haile, Dawit Assefa",Optics express,3,low,high,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sex estimation using continuous variables: Problems and principles of sex classification in the zone of uncertainty,"Discriminant function analysis using continuous bone measurements provides a highly efficient tool for sex estimation in forensic practice. We show that three aspects are especially important for a reliable application of DFA in sex estimation: (1) the accuracy of sex classification should be calculated by using cross-validation, as non-cross-validated accuracies usually overestimate the true classification rate. Given that an accuracy greater than or equal to 80% is part of the Daubert criteria for admissibility, an unbiased estimate of the classification rate is of high relevance for forensic practice. (2) The sex of an unknown individual should be estimated by a population-specific discriminant function that was derived from the population to which the individual is thought to belong. The application of a discriminant function based on an unrelated population may result in misclassifications and may produce a large sex bias, that is, large differences between the classification rates for females and males. (3) Sex estimation in the zone of uncertainty, that is, the overlapping area between the sexes, should be avoided to prevent misclassifications. Sex should be assigned only to those individuals with a posterior probability of being female or male higher than 0.95. Although such an approach limits the practical applicability of DFs, because some portion of the individuals remains unclassified, it allows a high classification accuracy to be maintained at the individual level. It is worth considering extending the Daubert criteria by adding a posterior probability threshold to the sex estimation procedure, as a reliable sex estimation of every single individual, and not only the overall accuracy across the entire sample, is of utmost importance in forensic practice.",10103.0,"Galeta, Patrik:Brůžek, Jaroslav",Statistics and Probability in Forensic Anthropology,3,low,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Transparent and luminescent glasses of gold thiolate coordination polymers,"Obtaining transparent glasses made of functional coordination polymers (CPs) represents a tremendous opportunity for optical applications. In this context, the first transparent and red-emissive glasses of gold thiolate CPs have been obtained by simply applying mechanical pressure to amorphous powders of CPs. The three gold-based CP glasses are composed of either thiophenolate [Au(SPh)]n, phenylmethanethiolate [Au(SMePh)]n or phenylethanethiolate [Au(SEtPh)]n. The presence of a longer alkyl chain between the thiolate and the phenyl ring led to the formation of glass with higher transparency. The glass transitions, measured by thermomechanical analysis (TMA), occurred at lower temperature for CPs with longer alkyl chains. In addition, all three gold thiolate glasses exhibit red emission at 93 K and one of them, [Au(SMePh)]n, remains luminescent even at room temperature. An in-depth structural study of the amorphous gold thiolates by XRD, PDF and EXAFS analysis showed that they are formed of disordered doubly interpenetrated helical chains.

She elaborates a concept of lived critique and argues that although migrants´ lived critique does not take a form of a traditional political protest, understanding social and economic migrants as a structural group allows us to capture their lived critique as a source of critique of global injustice and cosmopolitan claims for global justice and human rights. The author argues that economic and social migration represents a resistance to global social injustice and suggests that migrants in their everyday struggles question the legitimacy of present-day global order on the one hand and nationally bounded migration laws on the other hand.",50601.0,"Uhde, Zuzana",Challenging the Borders of Justice in the Age of Migrations,3,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Basic economic gap related to smoking: Reconciling tobacco tax receipts and economic costs of smoking-attributable diseases,"Background: Tobacco tax rates set by various governments are not based on the idea that tax receipts should cover the costs incurred by smoking. It can be assumed that tobacco tax receipts (TTR) differ from the costs of smoking. The aim is to determine the global basic economic gap (BEG) between TTR and the economic costs of smoking-attributable diseases (ECS). Methods: BEG is described as the difference between the ECS and TTR. A total of 124 countries representing 94% of global tobacco consumption were included in the research by means of the creation of a database, the adjustment of input data and the identification of their intersection. Results: The global BEG reaches US$1438 billion per year. The global ECS are US$1911 billion per year. The global TTR are US$473 billion per year and compensate for only one quarter of the ECS. Within countries with the highest consumption of cigarettes, especially the USA but also Russia and Germany, the proportion of the ECS covered by the TTR is even lower, although private health expenditures have been taken into account. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that tobacco taxes would have to be globally increased by more than four times on average in order to cover the ECS or between two and two-and-a-half times if we take private health expenditures into account. The informational pressure concerning health risks associated with smoking aimed at reducing harmful consumption and improving global health can also be supported with these economic facts.",50206.0,"David, Petr",Tobacco Control,3,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Public Attitudes to Sustainable Energy Transitions in the Visegrad Four: Historical Legacy and Emerging Trends,"Ensuring a reliable and secure energy supply becomes increasingly challenging when the internationalization of energy markets, rising energy prices, and a continuing dependence on fossil fuels have to be additionally reconciled with ambitious climate mitigation goals and transition to more sustainable energy systems (World Energy Council 2013). In this light, members of the Visegrad Group (V4, Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) are often seen as foot-draggerson climate action in the EU. In recent years, the V4 undermined the EU ambitious climate agenda on several occasions by protesting significant greenhouse gas emissions cuts or blocking the EU 2050 carbon-neutral target (Renssen 2014, Morgan 2019, Zeilina 2019). Simultaneously, heavy reliance on fossil fuels in Poland and Czechia, and the region-wide struggle to overcome common trends towards ever-larger generation units at the expense of more decentralized forms of energy, often put the V4 at odds with the EU&apos,s goal of sustainable energy transitions. The example of countries like Germany showed that high societal mobilization and environmental awareness can lead to very tangible energy policy results as far as transitions to sustainable energy systems are concerned, and even change the main energy policy course into a more socially acceptable one (Buchan 2012). In Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries with traditionally centralized political authority and the communist legacy of separating societal actors from the management of resources (Jehlicka and Smith 2007), active interest in the energy and climate issues does not come easy. Moreover, specific geopolitical factors that made the V4 region more dependent on Russian energy resources serve as an additional trigger for this growing public support for renewable energy sources (RES), stronger energy efﬁciency measures, or the development of clean energy technologies at the expense of traditional energy branches.",50601.0,"Surwillo, Izabela:Popovic, Milos",From Economic to Energy Transition.

Comparison of early (2 days) and later (28 days) response of adipose tissue to very-low calorie diet in obese women,"CONTEXT: Beneficial metabolic effects of calorie restriction found in the early stage of hypocalorie diets may be caused by the modulation of metabolic and endocrine function of adipose tissue. OBJECTIVE: To compare metabolic and inflammation-related characteristics of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAAT) in the early (2 days) and later (28 days) phase of VLCD. Design, Setting, Intervention and Patients: 17 moderately obese premenopausal women followed 800 kcal/d VLCD for 28 days. Anthropometric measurements, blood sampling and biopsy of SAAT were performed before diet and after 2 and 28 days of VLCD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): mRNA expression of 50 genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis were analyzed in SAAT. Secretion of adipokines was determined in SAAT explants and adipokines, FGF21 and CRP were measured in plasma. RESULTS: In the early phase of VLCD expression of lipolytic genes was increased while expression of lipogenic genes was significantly suppressed. The inflammatory markers in SAAT remained unchanged. At the later phase, expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and β-oxidation was markedly suppressed, while expression of inflammatory markers was increased. The changes of lipogenic genes after 28 days of VLCD correlated with FGF21 changes. CONCLUSION: The early and later phases of VLCD differ in respect to metabolic and inflammatory responses in SAAT. The expression changes in SAAT in the early phase of VLCD could not explain the effect of short calorie restriction on the improvement of insulin sensitivity. An interplay of SAAT with liver function during VLCD mediated by FGF21 might be suggested.",0.0,"Šrámková, Veronika:Rossmeislová, Lenka:Krauzová, Eva:Kračmerová, Jana:Koc, Michal:Langin, Dominique:Štich, Vladimír:Šiklová, Michaela","The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp, Metabolism",3,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Application of GIS to Empirical Windthrow Risk Model in Mountain Forested Landscapes,"Norway spruce dominates mountain forests in Europe. Natural variations in the mountainous coniferous forests are strongly influenced by all the main components of forest and landscape dynamics: species diversity, the structure of forest stands, nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and other ecosystem services. This paper deals with an empirical windthrow risk model based on the integration of logistic regression into GIS to assess forest vulnerability to wind-disturbance in the mountain spruce forests of Sumava National Park (Czech Republic). It is an area where forest management has been the focus of international discussions by conservationists, forest managers, and stakeholders. The authors developed the empirical windthrow risk model, which involves designing an optimized data structure containing dependent and independent variables entering logistic regression.

On the modelling turbulent transition in turbine cascades with flow separation,"The work discusses performance, modification and implementation details of three intermittency based transition models. The intermittency is applied in the SST eddy viscosity turbulence model and in an explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model (EARSM). Experimental results of transonic flows through turbine cascades at different Reynolds numbers are used as test cases, where the interaction of shock wave with laminar or turbulent boundary layer can be distinguished and reproduced in simulations. Of the transition models tested, only the criteria based (gamma-zeta model captures well the influence of Reynolds number on the transition. The criterion for transition on separation bubble has been re-formulated so that the model is local in stream-wise direction and applicable also in 3D flows. The model is still non-local in wall- normal direction but this is found acceptable considering its performance and the fact that its evaluation is made fully automatic in the framework of structured multi-block solver.",20302.0,"Louda, Petr:Příhoda, Jaromír",Computers & Fluids,3,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Image Invariants to Anisotropic Gaussian Blur,"The paper presents a new theory of invariants to Gaussian blur. Unlike earlier methods, the blur kernel may be arbitrary oriented, scaled and elongated. Such blurring is a semi-group action in the image space, where the orbits are classes of blur-equivalent images. We propose a non-linear projection operator which extracts blur-insensitive component of the image. The invariants are then formally defined as moments of this component but can be computed directly from the blurred image without an explicit construction of the projections. Image description by the new invariants does not require any prior knowledge of the particular blur kernel shape and does not include any deconvolution. Potential applications are in blur-invariant image recognition and in robust template matching.",10201.0,"Kostková, Jitka:Flusser, Jan:Lébl, Matěj:Pedone, M.","Image Analysis : 21st Scandinavian Conference, SCIA 2019",3,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Correlation between ischemic index of retinal vein occlusion and oxygen saturation in retinal vessels,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between the ischemic index and the oxygen saturation in retinal vessels in patients with retinal vein occlusion. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study. METHODS: We performed a prospective study. The cohort consisted of 43 eyes of 43 patients with retinal vein occlusions (RVO), 23 of whom had central retinal vein occlusions (CRVO) and 20 who had branch retinal vein occlusions (BRVO). We evaluated the retinal vessel saturation using an automatic retinal oximetry device. The retinal ischemic index (ISI) was determined using ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography. RESULTS: Mean arterial saturation (±SD) was 100% ± 11%, mean vein saturation was 52% ±13%, and mean A-V difference was 48% ± 16% in eyes with BRVO. The average ISI in the same group was 0.48 (range 0-1). There was no statistically significant correlation between the retinal ischemic index and retinal saturation in the BRVO group. The affected eye in the CRVO group had a mean arterial saturation of 101% ± 6%, vein saturation of 44% ± 11 % and A-V difference of 58% ± 10%. The average ISI in the CRVO group was 0.54 (range 0-1). A statistically significant negative correlation between ISI and vein saturation was found in the CRVO group (r = -0.686, P =.0003). A significant positive correlation between ISI and the A-V difference was found in the CRVO group (r = 0.893, P &lt,.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Oxygen saturation in the retinal vein and the arteriovenous difference correlated with the ischemic index in CRVO patients.

Photocurrent spectroscopy of perovskite layers and solar cells: a sensitive probe of material degradation,"Optical absorptance spectroscopy of polycrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 films usually indicates the presence of a PbI2 phase, either as a preparation residue or due to film degradation, but gives no insight on how this may affect electrical properties. Here, we apply photocurrent spectroscopy to both perovskite solar cells and coplanar-contacted layers at various stages of degradation. In both cases, we find that the presence of a PbI2 phase restricts charge-carrier transport, suggesting that PbI2 encapsulates CH3NH3PbI3 grains.

Colloidal Bio-nanoparticles in Polymer fibers: Current Trends and Future Prospects,"Biotechnology and bio-nanotechnology are emerging fields that inspire vast scientific and engineering inquiry. Bio-nanotechnology is relatively new and dynamic, applying biological principles to produce new systems and materials at nanoscale level. Eco-friendly nano-material development and production by biosynthesis has aninteresting niche, where metallic andfunctionally diverse biosynthesized nanoparticles (bio-NPs) are prepared by exploiting both biological processes in microorganisms andbiochemical reactions in plant extracts and other biomass. The major advantage of this approach is one-step chemical reduction and stabilization, with the two principal components providing toxic-free intermediates in the bio-NP genesis. This heralds exciting possibilities for inexpensive NP production and consequent rapid and wide adoption of novel applications, such asincorporation of bio-NPsto augment polymer nanofiber properties. This chapter presents an overview of critical aspects of the composite materials’design and development.The recognized mechanics of bio-NP formation is followed by idiosyncrasies in choice of the core material and the “host” environment where synthesis occurs, and the physical and chemical characterization of resultant bio-NPs.

Partial replacement of soybean meal by white lupine seeds in the diet of dairy cows,"Objective: An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of partial replacement of soybean meal (SBM) by white lupine seeds (WLS) on milk yield and quality, feed efficiency and rumen fermentation of high-yielding dairy cows. Methods: Thirty multiparous cows of two breeds (20 Holstein and 10 Czech Pied cows) in early mid-lactation received three diets (treatments) in a 3x3 Latin square design with a 28-d period. The dietary treatments were as follows: CON (control total mixed ration with SBM, no WLS), WLS30 (30% of the SBM was replaced, on a dry matter basis, by WLS), and WLS50 (50% of the SBM was replaced by WLS). Results: Feed intake by the cows was not affected (p = 0.331) by the diets. Milk production decreased with increasing proportions of WLS in the diet. Cows fed WLS50 yielded approximately less milk than cows fed the CON diet. The proportions of milk fat (p = 0.640), protein (p = 0.507), and lactose (p = 0.709) were not altered by the diet. For milk fat, feeding with WLS50 reduced the proportion of total saturated fatty acids (p < 0.001) and increased the proportion of total monounsaturated fatty acids (p < 0.001), mainly through oleic acid (p < 0.001). No differences were found in feed efficiency, body weight, and blood plasma metabolites between groups. Rumen ammonia-N levels tended (p = 0.087) to increase with increasing proportions of WLS in the diet, whereas no effect of diet on rumen pH was found (p = 0.558). Conclusion: We did not identify the safe range within which raw WLS can efficiently replace SBM in the diet of high-producing dairy cows. In contrast, even partial replacement of SBM by WLS favorably changed the milk fatty acid profile.",40201.0,"Joch, Miroslav:Kudrna, Václav",Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences ,3,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
PERISCOPE: road towards effective control of pertussis,"The resurgence and changing epidemiology of pertussis in high-income countries, the high infant mortality caused by pertussis in low-income countries, and the increasing morbidity in all age groups worldwide call for a concerted effort to both improve the current vaccines and develop new vaccines and vaccination strategies against pertussis. In this Personal View, we identify several key obstacles on the path to developing a durable solution for global control of pertussis. To systematically address these obstacles, the PERtussIS Correlates Of Protection Europe ( PERISCOPE) Consortium was established in March, 2016. The objectives of this consortium are to increase scientific understanding of immunity to pertussis in humans induced by vaccines and infections, to identify biomarkers of protective immunity, and to generate technologies and infrastructure for the future development of improved pertussis vaccines. By working towards the accelerated licensure and implementation of novel, well tolerated, and effective pertussis vaccines, we hope to strengthen and stimulate further collaboration and transparency between the key stakeholders, including the public, the scientific community, public health institutes, regulatory authorities, and vaccine manufacturers.",10606.0,"Diavatopoulos, D.A.:Šebo, Peter:Večerek, Branislav",Lancet Infectious Diseases,3,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Climate in the Past and Present in the Czech Lands in the Central European Context,Central Europe and Czech Lands (recent Czech republic) itself have recently represented an area with a transitional type between the oceanic and continental types of temperate climate. The climate changed during geological history and various climates played an important role in the evolution of landforms due to changes in type and intensity of weathering and earth surface processes. This chapter describes general trends in climate oscillations during the Tertiary and the Quaternary within the Czech Lands and Central Europe.

Spherical gravitational curvature boundary-value problem,"Values of scalar, vector and second-order tensor parameters of the Earth&apos,s gravitational field have been collected by various sensors in geodesy and geophysics. Such observables have been widely exploited in different parametrization methods for the gravitational field modelling. Moreover, theoretical aspects of these quantities have extensively been studied and well understood. On the other hand, new sensors for observing gravitational curvatures, i.e., components of the third-order gravitational tensor, are currently under development. As the gravitational curvatures represent new types of observables, their exploitation for modelling of the Earth&apos,s gravitational field is a subject of this study. Firstly, the gravitational curvature tensor is decomposed into six parts which are expanded in terms of third-order tensor spherical harmonics. Secondly, gravitational curvature boundary-value problems defined for four combinations of the gravitational curvatures are formulated and solved in spectral and spatial domains. Thirdly, properties of the corresponding sub-integrals are investigated.

On the mechanism of colloidal silica action to improve flow properties of pharmaceutical excipients,"The mechanism of colloidal silica action to improve flow properties of pharmaceutical powders is known to be based on inter-particle force disruption by silica particles adhered to the particle surface. In the present article, the kinetic aspects of this action are investigated, focusing on non-spherical particles of different size. Blends comprising microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate and colloidal silica were examined using powder rheometer. The blends were formulated to represent effects of particle size, surface texture, colloidal silica loading, and mixing time. Pre-conditioning, shear testing, compressibility, and flow energy measurements were used to monitor flow properties. Components and blends were analyzed using particle size analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and back-scattered electron (BSE) detection to determine surface particle arrangement. All studied parameters were found to have substantial effects on flow properties of powder blends. Those effects were explained by identifying key steps of colloidal silica action, which were found to proceed at substantially different rates, causing the flow properties change over time being dependent on the blend formulation and the component properties.",30104.0,"Tran, Diem Trang:Majerová, Diana:Veselý, Martin:Kulaviak, Lukáš:Růžička, Marek:Zámostný, Petr",International Journal of Pharmaceutics,3,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Analysis and design aspects of delayed resonator absorber with position, velocity or acceleration feedback","A thorough analysis of six delayed resonator configurations is performed. Considering either lumped or distributed delays, feedback is taken from acceleration, velocity or position measurements. Next to presenting stability maps derived by the Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots, the robustness in the vibration suppression is analyzed. It is shown that the deterioration of vibration suppression caused by mismatch between the design and true excitation frequencies can be decreased by a proper selection of the delayed resonator configuration and the frequency operable range. Besides, the force and energy demands from the resonator feedback are studied with respect to the absorber physical parameters. All the results are derived for a dimensionless model form and as such they are universally valid. Thus, with respect to the important design specifications, the analysis is complete and can be used as guidelines for parametrization of the given delayed resonator set, with respect to the operable conditions.

Equipment for Testing Measuring Devices at a Low-Level Radon Activity Concentration,"The National Institute for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection, under the European project 16ENV10 MetroRADON (the European metrology program for innovation and research, EMPIR), has developed unique equipment for the testing of measuring devices at low-level radon activity concentrations. The equipment consists particularly of an airtight low-level radon chamber (LLRCH) with an inner volume of 324 liters, a Rn-222 type RF 5 flow-through source with a Ra-226 activity of 4.955 kBq developed by Czech Metrological Institute within the above-mentioned project, and a pressure vessel as a radon-free air source. The mass flow controller of the Bronkhorst EL-Flow type is a part of the apparatus and ensures the requested airflow through the radon source-partialized if necessary-through the chamber. The homogeneity of the atmosphere in the chamber is ensured by means of a continuously regulated fan (airflows in the range of 0.1-3.5 m·s-1 can be established). Another important chamber component is the measuring device of climatic conditions, since temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity must be determined. The construction of the equipment allows the time-stable radon activity concentration to be maintained at a precise level for several days. Radon concentration values can be arbitrarily and continuously set in the range from 100 Bq·m-3 to 300 Bq·m-3.",10700.0,"Fialová, Eliška:Otáhal, Petr:Vošahlík, Josef:Mazanová, Monika",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,3,low,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The analysis shows mixed results, especially concerning income inequality. Countries are then divided into countries with and without a history of communist rule and the differences between them are tested.

Revitalising and Innovating Tradition: The Individual Motivations behind New Songs in the Slovácko Region,"This study focuses on new songs based upon the folklore tradition. It evaluates field research in the Slovácko region carried out over several years. The study analyses the role played by the individual as a creative figure, who builds upon the region’s song tradition and folklore studies in the latter half of the 20th century. Three specific cases are used to demonstrate individuals’ varying motivation, their personal creative input, and the various ‘compositional’ approaches. Further, the article discusses the difference between maintaining the cultural heritage and innovating tradition.The author highlights conflicts between the urge to preserve the cultural heritage and to innovate traditional forms. The presentation of folklore in the mass media over time, for instance, has resulted in a large cross-section of the public preferring well-established, familiar versions of some songs—the so-called ‘correct’ versions. Songs codified in recognized songbook additions are also taken to be correct. By contrast, innovation of tradition, including new songs, is rejected.

Equations of a new puff model for idealized urban canopy,"During a leakage of hazardous materials, emergency services need to predict the evolution of the accident. In such situations, fast models are used. Such models can produce reasonable results for long-term leakages, but short-term leakage results can be underestimated by as much as a full order of magnitude (shown in the COST ES1006 project). Hence, the main aim of this paper is to present equations for recalculating the continuous source results to achieve results valid for the short-term source. The model would consist of a sub-model utilized for the continuous source in combination with the equations introduced in the paper.

"Statutory Limitation Of Crimes Under International Law: Lessons Taken From The Prosecution Of Nazi Criminals In Germany After 1945 And The New ""Demjanjuk Case Law""","Taken from the historical perspective, the article primarily examines the issue of (non-) applicability of statutes of limitation to crimes under international law, both from the perspective of the international and national law. Speaking in more detail, this paper looks at the lengthy and variable process of dealing with Nazi criminals after the WWII. It focuses especially on the prosecution of Nazi criminals in (West) Germany, which strictly adhered to application of laws of domestic provenance. Thus, among other principal challenges, the prosecuting officers (as well as the courts and the legislators) had to deal with the issue of the statute of limitation in cases of crimes, which were (as time passed by) often perpetrated several decades earlier. This approach stood in contrast to the position of the international criminal law, which generally provides for the non-applicability of the statutory limitation to crimes under international law. This topic is still actual as we may recently observe in Germany perhaps the last attempts of the prosecuting authorities to bring the deemed perpetrators of the Nazi crimes before the courts. Not only in the well covered John Demjanjuk case we could witness an attempt of the German courts to overcome the statutory limitations through a new interpretative approach to the institute of accessory to murder under the German Criminal Code. However, this shift in the German case law has not been confirmed by higher courts yet and is sometimes also subjected to criticism by legal scholars.",50501.0,"Kohout, David",International Comparative Jurisprudence,4,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Microstructure and phase stability of W-Cr alloy prepared by spark plasma sintering,"Tungsten alloys currently represent prospective candidates to replace tungsten in the first wall applications in future fusion facilities. Tungsten has many advantageous features, however, it is rather susceptible to oxidation at temperatures above around 500 degrees C. To mitigate/suppress this, various oxide-forming elements are being added to tungsten to induce self-passivation. The most common ones are chromium, titanium and silicon. The alloyed powder is frequently prepared by mechanical alloying and then consolidated by a sintering method. Most of the published results are related to alloys consolidated by HIP process that leads to formation of multiphase material.

Valuation of fermentation residues from biogas stations,"The recent decade of unprecedented support for renewable energy in Central Europe has led to a boom in the construction of biogas plants (among others). As renewables are coming close to being price competitive, this trend is passing onto a global scale and it is the developing countries in particular that are interested in technology transfer. Regardless of whether the biogas plant processes biowaste or purpose-grown phytomass, nowadays both are interlinked with farming practice, because it generates voluminous quantities of highly-diluted fermentation residues (FRs). These are routinely plowed into local arable land, however, there are uncertainties regarding their agrochemical and economic value. The Knezice biogas station was used for the research. The composition of the feedstock at the biogas station Kněžice is similar to other biogas stations in the region and the fermentation residues obtained are not inhibited by heavy metals, organic pollutants or any other inhibitors, which is a good prerequisite for the general applicability of the findings obtained.",50200.0,"Vochozka, Marek:Maroušková, Anna","Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization, and Environmental Effects",4,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Syntactic structures as carriers of emphatic expression in literary translation from English into Czech and vice versa,"The emphatic expression in translation represents a complex area within the field of translation, involving grammatical, lexical, stylistic and pragmatic aspects of the languages concerned. The word order as an important carrier of sentence dynamism has a substantial impact on the overall impression that a text makes on the addressee. As English and Czech represent typologically different languages, where the status of word order differs substantially, the Czech translation of the English sentences with marked word order represents a demanding and highly challenging task. The paper focuses on the English and Czech literary works of renowned authors of the 20th century, published in the original and translated versions, and their analysis and comparison in terms of adequacy of the force of the sentence dynamism. An additional goal of these observations is to examine their application in the teaching process at tertiary level.

Cardiac multimarker testing in non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"The natural history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) varies from an asymptomatic and benign clinical course to sudden premature death. Therefore, the new markers are searched with the aim to detect risk patients and improve their prognosis. The aim of this study was to test a cardiac multimarker testing strategy in detection of initial structural changes in patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In the group of 47 patients with nonobstructive HCM (58.4 +- 12.4 years, 12 emales) the mean left ventricle mass was 344.8 +- 129.9 g, the mean left ventricle mass index was 171.4 +- 60.2 g.m-2. We observed increased concentration of cardiac markers in peripheral blood: high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT): median: 9 ng/L (IQR: 5 - 16 ng/L), vs. controls: 7 (5 - 9) ng/L, p 0.03, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK MB): 2 (1.4 - 2.7) μg/L vs. 1.6 (1.1 - 2.2) μg/L, p 0.04, myoglobin 46.4 (33.3 - 65.2) μg/L vs. 35.6 (22.8 - 43.7) μg/L, p 0.001, heart type of fatty acid binding protein (hFABP): 1.8 (1.4 - 3.3) μg/L vs. 1.6 (1.3 - 2.1) μg/L, p 0.05, glycogen phosphorylase BB (GPBB): 3.9 (2.5 - 6.3) μg/L vs. 2.3 (1.9 - 4.2) μg/L, p 0.001.

Resilience Assessment in Electricity Critical Infrastructure from the Point of View of Converged Security,"In terms of service provision, the electricity sector is the most important sector of critical infrastructure, on the supply of which the vast majority of society and its basic vital functions depend. Extensive disruption of these supplies would have negative effects not only on basic human needs, but also on the economy and security of the state. For this reason, it is necessary to ensure permanent and comprehensive monitoring of the infrastructure elements resilience level, especially against threats with a multispectral impact on several areas of security. For this reason, the authors of the article developed the Converged Resilience Assessment (CRA) method, which enables advanced assessment of the electricity critical infrastructure elements resilience from the converged security point of view. Converged security in this case combines (converges) physical, cyber and operational security into a complementary unit. This reflects the integral determinants of resilience across related areas of security/safety. The CRA method focuses mainly on information and situation management, which integrates and correlates information (signals) from systems and sensors in order to obtain an overview of the situation and the subsequent effective management of its solution. The practical use of the proposed method is demonstrated on a selected element of the Czech Republic transmission system. The CRA method is currently embodied in a functional sample that has been piloted on several TSO elements. Further development of this method is seen mainly in fulfilling the logic of network infrastructure and reflection between elementary and intersectoral links in the context of synergistic and cascading effects in a broader context.",50902.0,"Hromada, Martin:Řehák, David:Lukáš, Luděk",Energies,4,medium,high,1,1,high,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Comparison between success rates for smokers re-treated by a smokers' clinic and success rates for smokers treated for the first time,"Aims: To compare success rates and characteristics of smokers treated a second time by a smokers&apos, clinic with success rates of their first treatment. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tobacco Dependence Treatment clinic in Prague, Czech Republic, between 2005 and 2017. Participants: A total of 5225 smokers treated either once (n = 5006, single treatment sample, SS) or also second time (n = 219, re-treated sample, RS), on average 4.47 years after the first visit. Intervention: Smokers received intensive treatment of tobacco dependence with pharmacotherapy options. Outcomes were evaluated after 1 year. In case of failure or relapse, participants could undergo re-treatment in the same setting at least 1 year after the start of the first treatment. Measurements: Twelve-month self-reported continuous abstinence, CO-validated (&lt,= 6 parts per million), number of visits, type of pharmacotherapy, mental health history, Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence, time between first and second treatment. Results: The abstinence rate in the SS was 34.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.4%, 36.1%] and in the RS was 37% (95% CI = 30.6%, 43.8%) and 39.7% (95% CI = 33.2%, 45.5%) for their first and second treatments, respectively. The samples were comparable on smoking and socio-demographic characteristics and pharmacotherapy used, but the RS in the second treatment had a higher prevalence of diagnosed mental health disorder at 39.3% (95% CI = 32.8%, 46.1%) compared with 23.7% (95% CI = 22.5%, 24.9%) in the SS.

On the thirty-year horizon, AI can replace over 50% of capabilities in the vast majority of the current professions. At the same time, new professions will continuously emerge, though they will place different demands on their performers and will require different skills and capabilities in comparison to current professions.

The de-institutionalisation of care for older people in the Czech Republic and Slovakia : national strategies and local outcomes,"The chapter focuses on the implementation of de-institutionalisation in care for older people in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia. The principles of de-institutionalisation were incorporated in the national strategic documents of both countries after the 2004 accession to the European Union. First the question of how this concept influenced the Czech and Slovak national strategies, legislation and organisation of social services for older people is tackled. Subsequently, the question of what were the ‘responses’ of regional and local authorities and providers of care services for older people are addressed. Two case studies are then presented, which illustrate the ambivalent nature of the de-institutionalisation process. Particular attention is paid to the new role played by domiciliary care since this service form takes a central role as a ‘substitute’ for outdated or expensive institutionalised care. The chapter highlights how, even though a de-institutionalisation strategy was introduced at the national level in both countries, it was implemented without guaranteeing a constant and steady flow of financial resources, and the transition of national policy priorities to a ‘new’ conception of care for older people at the regional and local levels has been rather slow.

"Size-resolved, quantitative evaluation of the magnetic mineralogy of airborne brake-wear particulate emissions","Exposure to particulate air pollution has been associated with a variety of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological problems, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Brake-wear emissions are one of the major sources of metal-rich airborne particulate pollution in roadside environments. Of potentially bioreactive metals, Fe (especially in its ferrous form, Fe2+) might play a specific role in both neurological and cardiovascular impairments. Here, we collected brake-wear particulate emissions using a full-scale brake dynamometer, and used a combination of magnetic measurements and electron microscopy to make quantitative evaluation of the magnetic composition and particle size of airborne emissions originating from passenger car brake systems. Our results show that the concentrations of Fe-rich magnetic grains in airborne brake-wear emissions are very high (i.e., -100-10,000 x higher), compared to other types of particulate pollutants produced in most urban environments. From magnetic component analysis, the average magnetite mass concentration in total PM10 of brake emissions is -20.2 wt% and metallic Fe -1.6 wt%. Most brake-wear airborne particles (&gt,99 % of particle number concentration) are smaller than 200 nm. Using low-temperature magnetic measurements, we observed a strong superparamagnetic signal (indicative of ultrafine magnetic particles, &lt, -30 nm) for all of the analysed size fractions of airborne brake-wear particles. Transmission electron microscopy independently shows that even the larger size fractions of airborne brake-wear emissions dominantly comprise agglomerates of ultrafine (&lt,100 nm) particles (UFPs). Such UFPs likely pose a threat to neuronal and cardiovascular health after inhalation and/or ingestion. The observed abundance of ultrafine magnetite particles (estimated to constitute -7.6 wt% of PM0.2) might be especially hazardous to the brain, contributing both to microglial inflammatory action and excess generation of reactive oxygen species.",20505.0,"Gonet, Tomasz:Maher, Barbara A:Nyiro-Kosa, Ilona:Posfai, Mihaly:Vaculík, Miroslav:Kukutschová, Jana",Environmental Pollution,4,high,high,0,1,high,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

Atomic Charge Calculator II: web-based tool for the calculation of partial atomic charges,"Partial atomic charges serve as a simple model for the electrostatic distribution of a molecule that drives its interactions with its surroundings. Since partial atomic charges are frequently used in computational chemistry, chemoinformatics and bioinformatics, many computational approaches for calculating them have been introduced. The most applicable are fast and reasonably accurate empirical charge calculation approaches. Here, we introduce Atomic Charge Calculator II (ACC II), a web application that enables the calculation of partial atomic charges via all the main empirical approaches and for all types of molecules. ACC II implements 17 empirical charge calculation methods, including the highly cited (QEq, EEM), the recently published (EQeq, EQeq+C), and the old but still often used (PEOE). ACC II enables the fast calculation of charges even for large macromolecular structures. The web server also offers charge visualization, courtesy of the powerful LiteMol viewer.

Fuzzy Sets and Algebraic Hyperoperations to Model Interpersonal Relations,"In Social Sciences propositions and descriptions of interpersonal relationships are given by means of linguistic expressions, which cannot be formalized with the classic binary logic. Then a necessary tool are fuzzy sets that give the possibility to measure the degree of belonging of an element to a set described by a linguistic property or the degree of a relation between individuals. Moreover many times there is uncertainty on the result of an aggregation operation and we can have the necessity to consider together many possible results of the interaction of any ordered pair of elements, e.g. individuals. We propose the algebraic hyperoperations as very useful instruments to manage these types of uncertainty. We show as fuzzy relations and hypergroupoids permit to have an efficient representations of many aspects of social phenomena.",50901.0,"Hošková-Mayerová, Šárka:Maturo, Antonio",Recent Trends in Social Systems: Quantitative Theories and Quantitative Models,4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Determination of Bitter Compounds in Hops – Effect of Crop Year and Hops Age,"Our study is focused on mutual comparison of four methods of determination of alpha acids in hops (EBC 7.4, EBC 7.5, ČSN and EBC 7.7) and their application in evaluation of hops stored under different conditions. Furthermore, the results of the comparison of predicted and actual alpha acid values in the long-term monitoring of harvesting of three Czech hop varieties are discussed. The largest differences were found between the EBC 7.5 (LCV) and EBC 7.7 (HPLC) methods, the fi rst method gives systematically higher results and the difference exponentially increases with the hop storage index (HIS) value. The difference in HSI in fresh hops is 10 – 15% rel. while the difference in older hops with HSI 0.6 – 0.7 is 25 – 45% rel.

Cognitive behavioral therapy in pharmacoresistant obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: The aim of the study was to determine whether patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resistant to drug therapy may improve their condition using intensive, systematic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) lasting for 6 weeks, and whether it is possible to predict the therapeutic effect using demographic, clinical, and selected psychological characteristics at baseline. Methods: Sixty-six OCD patients were included in the study, of which 57 completed the program. The diagnosis was confirmed using the structured Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Patients were rated using the objective and subjective forms of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, objective and subjective forms of the Clinical Global Impression, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Dissociative Experiences Scale, 20-item Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire, and the Sheehan Disability Scale before their treatment, and with subjective Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, objective and subjective Clinical Global Impression, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory at the end of the treatment. Patients were treated with antidepressants and daily intensive group CBT for the 6-week period. Results: During the 6-week intensive CBT program in combination with pharmacotherapy, there was a significant improvement in patients suffering from OCD resistant to drug treatment. There were statistically significantly decrease in the scores assessing the severity of OCD symptoms, anxiety, and depressive feelings. A lower treatment effect was achieved specifically in patients who 1) showed fewer OCD themes in symptomatology, 2) showed a higher level of somatoform dissociation, 3) had poor insight, and 4) had a higher initial level of overall severity of the disorder. Remission of the disorder was more likely in patients who had 1) good insight, 2) a lower initial level of anxiety, and 3) no comorbid depressive disorder.",50101.0,"Vyskočilová, Jana:Prasko, Jan:Šípek, Jiří",Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment,4,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1

Continuous rheological description of highly filled polymer melts for material extrusion,"In additive manufacturing based on the material extrusion of filled polymer melts, a correct description of the rheological behaviour of the processed material is an important requirement. In case of highly filled feedstocks, complexities connected with a proper flow description are not only caused by the high pack- aging of powder particles (more than 50 vol.%) but also by the notable participation of polymer binder components in the quantification of shear viscosity. In this study, analytical expressions (master curves) of a true shear viscosity are developed to follow and continuously optimize the rheological dependence of the bulk feedstock on particular variables. A nickel-chromium-based compound (Inconel 718, content 59 vol.%) with thermoplastic binders of different molecular weight of polyethylene glycol was selected for the case study. The proposed master curves comprise simultaneously hitherto separately applied two corrections of an apparent shear viscosity: regarding the different capillary geometries with respect to en- trance pressure and outlet extension, and determining an actual velocity profile based on shear rate dis- tribution inside a feedstock. This approach eliminates the hitherto used non-Newtonian index, by means of which the logarithmic derivative was approximated. As the master curves depend exclusively on the shear rate and molecular weight of polyethylene glycol and do not involve any adjustable parameter, their application is straightforward. Their accuracy does not exceed experimental errors.",10305.0,"Filip, Petr:Hausnerová, B.:Hnátková, E.",Applied Materials Today,4,medium,high,0,1,high,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ethnicity or Language in the Population Census in 1910-1930 Slovakia (Czechoslovakia): Objectivity and Subjectivity of the Ethnic Make-up of a European Country between the Two World Wars,"In Slovakia, the concept of ethnicity was historically tied to two fundamental population attributes – language and community membership. While the statistical practice of the second half of 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th century favored language as the primary criterion for determing a person’s ethnicity, Czechoslovak statisticians assigned a larger role to a person’s self-reported membership in a community. The two characteristics of the ethnic composition of the country – the former objective, the latter subjective – were among the most contentious subjects of debate in the preparatory meetings of every census commission.

Nutritive value and mycotoxin contamination of herbage in mountain locality exposed to renewed cattle grazing,"The aim of the study was to estimate the forage quality and mycotoxin contamination in the locality of Švýcárna (1304 m a.s.l.), where the cattle grazing after the long-term management cessation was introduced on the pasture area of 3.6 ha in 2012. The pasture was divided into two grazing plots: P1 (Nar) (dominance of Nardus stricta) and P2 (Des) (dominance of Deschampsia cespitosa). Samples of forage were taken in June, July, August and September 2014 from five permanent plots situated in different places of locality. Samples were analysed on the content of basic nutrients and macro- and micro- elements. Further, the content of deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and T-2/ HT-2 toxin was determined using ELISA method.

Delayed Resonator With Distributed Delay in Acceleration Feedback—Design and Experimental Verification,"The main results of this paper are design, analysis, and experimental verification of a delayed resonator with a distributed-time-delay acceleration feedback. Analogously to the classical delayed resonator, the novel resonator is applied to suppress vibrations of a mechanical system. The theoretical part of this paper includes control parameter design and analysis of their ranges. Next, dynamical properties of the resonator are analyzed including the derivation of a complete stability picture for the combined resonator with the single-degree-of-freedom mechanical system. For the stability analysis, spectral methods are applied including the method of cluster treatment of characteristic roots. Utilizing the distributed delay instead of the lumped delay on the acceleration feedback, both the resonator and the overall system dynamics are converted fromneutral to more convenient retarded character. Another positive aspect of the distributed delay is that it acts like a moving average filter on the acceleration measurements. Furthermore, we perform a computational analysis of spectral properties using a numerical root-finding QPmR algorithm. All these stability findings are also verified experimentally on a laboratory setup designed and implemented for this purpose.",0.0,"Pilbauer, Dan:Vyhlídal, Tomáš:Olgac, N.",IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS,4,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Information stored in quantum states of water fragments,"Does water have memory? Well, not in the usual sense. But it is known, that if you tear water molecules apart, the remaining fragments can tell you a story about how it happened. To inves- tigate this phenomenon, a plasma reactor producing miniature lightnings in direct contact with water level was constructed. The electrical discharges are powerful enough to cause dis- sociation of water molecules in various ways. To facilitate the electrical breakdown, the atmosphere in the reactor was re- placed by argon. The water molecule can be broken by impact of sufficiently fast electron, absorption of deep UV photon or previously ex- cited argon atom. Each of these processes has a different en- ergy balance and the remaining energy is partially conserved in quantum states of the water fragments. By careful analysis of the light emitted by the relaxing OH radicals, we can dis- entangle the respective contributions to the total spectrum and calculate the portion of water molecules undergoing various dissociation mechanisms. The water fragments really remember what preceded their creation and they let us know by emitting photons. The time scale for ""forgetting"" depends on the collisional rate, i.e. the pressure.

"The Use of Organic Foods, Regional, Seasonal and Fresh Food in Public Caterings","The chapter focuses on possibilities to improve the quality of meals in public, especially school catering facilities. It presents the options for diet modifications towards a sustainable use of organic foods, local and seasonal food by optimizing portions of meat and meals prepared of fresh ingredients. From an economic, environmental and nutritional point of view, evaluation and comparison of the original and optimized meals can contribute to a more efficient use of foods and motivate staff in public catering facilities to comprehensive food assessment. An overall evaluation shows that more favorable nutritional parameters may be achieved by the optimalization of meals. A greater use of local, seasonal and organic foods, a reduction in meat portions and lower level of processing make energy and greenhouse gas emission savings and it is possible to sustain the costs within standard. The purchase during a season and shortened distribution channels may compensate the higher price of organic foods. The trend of increased use of ready-to-cook foods does not usually lead to a higher nutritional and health quality, lesser burden on the environment and an economic effect.

"Radioactivity in mushrooms from selected locations in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic.","137Cs is one of the most important radionuclides released in the course of atmospheric nuclear weapon tests and during accidents in nuclear power plants such as that in Chernobyl, Ukraine, or Fukushima, Japan. The aim of this study was to compare 137Cs and 40K concentrations in particular species of mushrooms from selected locations in the Bohemian Forest (Czech: Šumava), Czech Republic, where a considerable contamination from the Chernobyl accident had been measured in 1986. Samples were collected between June and October 2014. Activities of 137Cs and 40K per dry mass were measured by means of a semiconductor gamma spectrometer. The 137Cs values measured range from below detection limit to 4300 ? 20 Bq kg-1, in the case of 40K from 910 ? 80 to 4300 ? 230 Bq kg-1. Differences were found between individual locations, due to uneven precipitation in the course of the movement of the radioactive cloud after the Chernobyl accident. There are, however, also differences between individual species of mushrooms from identical locations, which inter alia result from different characteristics of the soil and depths of mycelia. The values measured are compared with established limits and exposures from other radiation sources present in the environment. In general, it can be stated that the values measured are relatively low and the effects on the health of the population are negligible compared to other sources of ionizing radiation.",10511.0,"Čadová, Michaela:Havránková, Renata:Havránek, Jiří:Zölzer, Friedo",Radiation and Environmental Biophysics,4,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Numerical and experimental investigation of flue gases heat recovery via condensing heat exchanger,"The ever increasing environmental awareness introduces the trend of increasing the efficiency of power plants via implementing waste heat recovery. This study reports two numerical models suitable for analyses of a condensing heat exchanger. The numerically predicted results are compared with the results acquired experimentally with the use of a coal-fired water condensing heat exchanger installed in the local laboratory of thermal engineering. The first applied mathematical model is a stationary 1D model based on our own modification of the Colburn-Hougen model. The second one is a proposed 3D multi-phase flow model based on the Euler model of mixture expanded by the model of condensation of water vapour from the flue gases. A thorough comparative analysis of the results of both the numerical models and the experimental ones showed very good correlation. The differences between all the acquired results for the temperatures of flue gases and heated water at the outlet of the heat exchanger did not exceed 4 degrees C. In cases of heat recovery with the occurrence of condensation, the latent heat has a significant influence on the flue gases and water temperatures at heat exchanger outlet.",20303.0,"Macháčková, Adéla:Kocich, Radim:Bojko, Marian:Kunčická, Lenka:Polko, Krzysztof",International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
PV Panel With Integrated Lithium Accumulators For BAPV Applications—One Year Thermal Evaluation,"A new glass-polysiloxane-glass laminate photovoltaic (PV) panel with integrated lithium accumulators was developed. It can be suitable for building attached photovoltaics (BAPV) applications like emergency power supply. But there is very limited information available about real outdoor long-term temperature evaluation of lithium accumulators integrated with PV panels. Recently, temperature of lithium accumulators integrated withPVpanels for period of one year was evaluated.Even at high ambient temperature +40 C, the temperature increase of lithium accumulators was at maximum +13 C during 8 A (0,2 capacity) charging/discharging cycles. As the operating temperature of lithium accumulators is limited to +65 C, it should work well in regions with ambient temperatures up to +50 C.

"The energy and environmental footprints of COVID-19 fighting measures - PPE, disinfection, supply chains","The still escalating COVID-19 pandemic also has a substantial impact on energy structure, requirements and related emissions. The consumption is unavoidable and receives a lower priority in the critical situation. However, as the pandemic continues, the impacts on energy and environment should be assessed and possibly reduced. This study aims to provide an overview of invested energy sources and environmental footprints in fighting the COVID-19. The required energy and resources consumption of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and testing kits have been discussed. The protecting efficiency returned on environmental footprint invested for masks has been further explored. The main observation pinpointed is that with a proper design standard, material selection and user guideline, reusable PPE could be an effective option with lower energy consumption/environmental footprint. Additional escalated energy consumption for aseptic and disinfection has been assessed. This includes the energy stemming from emergency and later managed supply chains. The outcomes emphasised that diversifying solutions to achieve the needed objective is a vital strategy to improve the susceptibility and provide higher flexibility in minimising the environmental footprints. However, more comprehensive research proof for the alternative solution (e.g. reusable option) towards low energy consumption without compromise on the effectiveness should be offered and advocated.

To enhance these findings, we investigated differences in eye movements while viewing nature scenes versus two categories of urban scenes. Apart from ordinary urban scenes, we also included the category of scenic images of old cities. The analysis of eye movements indicated lower eye movement activity while viewing nature scenes relative to ordinary urban scenes and also minor differences in eye movements between urban scenes and old city scenes.

The essay claims that the two books challenge the one-dimensional and somewhat deterministic notion of a blanket, all-encompassing social acceleration dynamic, purportedly enveloping the whole of modernity, by offering new conceptual insights and empirical illustrations. Not only do the currently fashionable perspectives on acceleration in the social sciences overlook the nuances in temporal experience and the inextricable link between “fast” and “slow,” they also neglect the emerging temporal divisions inherent in the expansive nature of new information and communication technologies.

Reactive power compensation in energy transmission systems with sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal currents,"A standout amongst the most noteworthy current talks in electrical designing is the meaning of the responsive power under nonsinusoidal conditions in nonlinear electric frameworks. New meanings of responsive power have been talked about in the most recent years. Despite the fact that the component of electric energy stream for nonsinusoidal conditions is all around depicted today, so toll is not yet accessible a summed up power hypothesis, and hypothetical figurings for the configuration of such gadgets as dynamic channels or element compensators. Thusly the undertaking of planning compensators for advance energy transmission with nonlinear time-fluctuating loads in nonsinusoidal administrations is, a long way from clear. Voltage and current harmonics created by nonlinear loads increment power losss in transmission frameworks and, in this manner, negatively affect effectivity of appropriation frameworks and parts. While a few harmonics are brought on by framework nonlinearities, for example, transformer immersion, most harmonic are delivered by power electronic loads, for example, flexible velocity drives and diode span rectifiers. In this paper the reactive power compensation for sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal circumstances, where nonlinear circuit voltages and streams contain harmonic are explained and reenacted. The results can be used for control algorithms of automatic compensators which are also described. The main aim of this article is based on the dissipative systems theory and therefore theory of cyclodissipativity which can be used for calculation of compensation elements (capacitors, inductors) for reactive power compensation. The compensation elements are determined by minimizing line losses. It will show that approach base on dissipative systems theory provides a important mathematical framework for analyzing and designing of compensators for reactive power compensation even for general nonlinear loads...",20201.0,"Štork, Milan:Mayer, Daniel",Reactive Power Control in AC Power Systems : Fundamentals and Current Issues,4,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Analysis of the impact of some equivalent circuit parameter variations on the sensitivity of the measured samples has been also carried out (particularly of those that can vary significantly due to the low-cost production).

Towards Human Cell Simulation,"The faithful reproduction and accurate prediction of the phe-notypes and emergent behaviors of complex cellular systems are among the most challenging goals in Systems Biology. Although mathematical models that describe the interactions among all biochemical processes in a cell are theoretically feasible, their simulation is generally hard because of a variety of reasons. For instance, many quantitative data (e.g., kinetic rates) are usually not available, a problem that hinders the execution of simulation algorithms as long as some parameter estimation methods are used. Though, even with a candidate parameterization, the simulation of mechanistic models could be challenging due to the extreme computational effort required. In this context, model reduction techniques and High-Performance Computing infrastructures could be leveraged to mitigate these issues. In addition, as cellular processes are characterized by multiple scales of temporal and spatial organization, novel hybrid simulators able to harmonize different modeling approaches (e.g., logic-based, constraint-based, continuous deterministic, discrete stochastic, spatial) should be designed.

EU u-Government: A Solution for More Citizen Participation in EU Policy-making,"EU democracy has been traditionally practised through representation. This chapter argues that more citizen participation in EU policy-making is plausible, thanks to ubiquitous computing, mixed reality technology and virtual spaces. Current technology and IT services can remedy problems of time and space, the biggest obstacles for active civic involvement in EU governance. The chapter starts with the advantages and disadvantages of applying ubiquitous government (u-government) in policy-making. The following section investigates how practising democracy at EU level can be facilitated through u-government, augmenting citizen participation in EU governance. The third section proposes a conceptual model for using mixed reality technology and u-government in the EU context. The conclusion briefly reflects on the future of citizen participation in the frame of an EU e-democracy.",0.0,"Fanoulis, Evangelos","Euroscepticism, Democracy and the Media: Communicating Europe, Contesting Europe",4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Simulation of damage in hybrid composite cell structure,"A novel type of hybrid cell composite structure has been developed and used for many practical applications. Typical macroscopic sub-cells in the cross sectional structure are formed by the stamping process of partially cured and axially oriented high modulus carbon fibre bundles. Each bundle is wrapped by a thin layer of high strength fibres. The main goal of this paper is the simulation of damage to this new composite structure. The modified hierarchy homogenisation method (i.e. Non-uniform Transformation Field Analysis) was proposed for simulation of the damage progress. Modification is based on the introduction of damage modes. The method is based on the assumption that the field of inelastic strain describing the damage to each constituent can be decomposed on a finite set of fields, called damage modes. The modified NTFA method was incorporated into a FEM code and verified in several four-point bending tests.",0.0,"Had, Jiří:Růžička, Milan",Applied Mechanics and Materials,4,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sмаrt City Evaluation Framework (SMACEF): Is a Smart City Solution Beneficial for Your City?,"There are currently presented ”smart city” solutions from the biggest worldwide corporations through start-ups up to the universities. It is indisputable that some of them are for sure very interesting and beneficial for citizens and cities themselves. Nevertheless, there are too many provided solutions that make it very hard to evaluate which are really beneficial and which are not. A simple and understandable framework that would allow cities to evaluate a proposed smart city solution is currently missing. The aim of this paper is to provide an approach for evaluation of particular smart city solutions and to determine whether it is suitable and beneficial for the city. Cities are dynamic, non-linear, complex systems and the evaluation cannot be done by a static and deterministic program in most cases, but dynamics and non-linearity of cities must be considered. While modeling is widely used in transportation or energy management, in the field of smart cities, no modeling approach has been used.

Muslims in the Modern Sense: Kabyles Negotiating Religious Identity in the Czech Republic,"In this paper, I examine the dynamics of deterritorilized identities of Kabyle immigrants to the Czech Republic focusing on the interconnection between ethnicity (i.e. Kabyle), national identity (i.e. Algerian), and religious identity (i.e. Muslim). In contrast with other immigrants’ groups coming from Muslim countries to Europe (such as Pakistanis in Great Britain or Algerian Arabs in France), Kabyles in the Czech Republic do not use their religious identity as a boundary marker and as a symbol of unification and exclusion. There are multiple reasons for this situation. Already in Algeria, Kabyles have an ambivalent relationship with Islam. The process of colonization and the subsequent construction of Algerian national identity, which stresses Arab identity, has excluded Kabyles, and has had a negative impact on their perception of Islam. Kabyle immigrants associate ‘kabylity’ with secular principles, modernity, individualism, and freedom. I analyze how their ideas about ‘kabylity’ and the specific character of their migration shape their religious practice. Despite their ambivalence towards Islam, many of them declare themselves as Muslims. They often rely on the phrase ‘Muslim in the modern sense’ in order to describe their religious identity. I interpret the meaning of these declarations and illustrate how this attitude serves as an efficient strategy for integration into an Islamophobic Czech society.",50404.0,"Hyánková, Tereza",Islam in the West.

The SC-35 Splicing Factor Interacts with RNA Pol II and A-Type Lamin Depletion Weakens This Interaction,"The essential components of splicing are the splicing factors accumulated in nuclear speckles, thus, we studied how DNA damaging agents and A-type lamin depletion affect the properties of these regions, positive on the SC-35 protein. We observed that inhibitor of PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase), and more pronouncedly inhibitors of RNA polymerases, caused DNA damage and increased the SC-35 protein level. Interestingly, nuclear blebs, induced by PARP inhibitor and observed in A-type lamin-depleted or senescent cells, were positive on both the SC-35 protein and another component of the spliceosome, SRRM2. In the interphase cell nuclei, SC-35 interacted with the phosphorylated form of RNAP II, which was A-type lamin-dependent. In mitotic cells, especially in telophase, the SC-35 protein formed a well-visible ring in the cytoplasmic fraction and colocalized with beta-catenin, associated with the plasma membrane. The antibody against the SRRM2 protein showed that nuclear speckles are already established in the cytoplasm of the late telophase and at the stage of early cytokinesis. In addition, we observed the occurrence of splicing factors in the nuclear blebs and micronuclei, which are also sites of both transcription and splicing. This conclusion supports the fact that splicing proceeds transcriptionally. According to our data, this process is A-type lamin-dependent. Lamin depletion also reduces the interaction between SC-35 and beta-catenin in mitotic cells.",10601.0,"Legartová, Soňa:Fagherazzi, Paolo:Stixová, Lenka:Kovařík, Aleš:Raška, I.:Bártová, Eva",Cells,4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Oxidative stress and heavy metals in plants,"Oxidative stress is a pathological process related to not only animal kingdom but also plants. Regarding oxidative stress in plants, heavy metals are frequently discussed as causative stimuli with relevance to ecology. Because heavy metals have broad technological importance, they can easily contaminate the environment. Much of previous effort regarding the harmful impact of the heavy metals was given to their toxicology in the animals and humans. Their implication in plant pathogeneses is less known and remains underestimated. The current paper summarizes basic facts about heavy metals, their distribution in soil, mobility, accumulation by plants, and initiation of oxidative stress including the decline in basal metabolism. The both actual and frontier studies in the field are summarized and discussed. The major pathophysiological pathways are introduced as well and link between heavy metals toxicity and their ability to initiate an oxidative damage is provided. Mobility and bioaccessibility of the metals is also considered as key factors in their impact on oxidative stress development in the plant. The metals like lead, mercury, copper, cadmium, iron, zinc, nickel, vanadium are depicted in the text. Heavy metals appear to be significant contributors to pathological processes in the plants and oxidative stress is probably an important contributor to the effect. The most sensitive plant species are enlisted and discussed in this review.

Exhibitions in Prague and Częstochowa and Czechs Visiting Poles in 1909 : Expressions of Neo-Slavism and Economic Nationalism,"This study examines the progress and overall background of two large-scale trips by Czechs to Polish cities in August and September 1909. Both trips took place in the spirit of Neo-Slavism and were intended to contribute to the development of Czech-Polish economic and cultural relations. In addition to discussions on trade and economic cooperation, these trips to cities in Galicia and the Russian Partition were also a display of mutual Czech-Polish solidarity. Despite the fact that this Czech-Polish cooperation was formed along the lines of Neo-Slavism and economic nationalism targeted against German economic hegemony and was not supposed to touch upon political issues, in reality it was not possible to avoid politics during these meetings, particularly the question of Russian-Polish relations and Czech and Polish policies at the Imperial Council.

Effect of the Parameters of Semi-Solid Processing on the Elimination of Sharp-Edged Primary Chromium Carbides from Tool Steel,"Although conventional tool steels have been heat treated on a routine basis for decades, the search continues for new ways to eliminate their troublesome sharp-edged primary chromium carbides, which impair toughness. One of the available techniques is semi-solid processing, which involves partial melting of the workpiece. The structure after semi-solid processing consisted of a austenite and carbide-austenite network. The network can be broken up and its fragments distributed uniformly by subsequent forming with appropriate parameters. In this experimental study, X210Cr12 tool steel was heated to a semi-solid state, and after cooling to a solid state, worked in a hydraulic press. Suitable soaking temperatures were sought within an interval between 1200 degrees C and 1280 degrees C. The workpieces were quenched from the forming temperature in water or oil. In order to improve formability and reduce hardness, tempering was tested as well. Additional experimental regimes included conventional quenching and tempering. Once the appropriate parameters were chosen, the elimination of primary chromium carbides was successful. The resultant microstructures were fine and consisted of M-A constituent with a size of approximately 1 mu m, and very fine Fe3C and Cr7C3 carbides. The hardness was in excess of 800 HV10. They were examined using optical and scanning electron microscopes. The carbides were characterized on transparent foils in a transmission electron microscope.

Fuzzy regression models and alternative operations for economic and social sciences,"The economic and social research is often based on assumptions that have little to do with reality, because all scientific knowledge of the Western world is based on the Aristotelian binary logic. Often researchers use rigid conventions and treat things as if they were black or white, but the world around us is nuanced, in other words, is fuzzy. In particular, problems inherent the inaccuracy of measurements and the vagueness of linguistic attributes has led many scholars to consider the fuzzy theory during the recent decades. In this paper we face a particular aspect of fuzzy logic, that is, fuzzy regression. After a brief review of the recent studies about this topic, we focus on some limitations of the previous approaches and suggest some possible solutions.

Biomechanical indices are more sensitive than diameter in predicting rupture of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms,"Objective: Several studies of biomechanical rupture risk assessment (BRRA) showed its advantage over the diameter criterion in rupture risk assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, BRRA studies have not investigated the predictability of biomechanical risk indices at different time points ahead of rupture, nor have they been performed blinded for biomechanical analysts. The objective of this study was to test the predictability of the BRRA method against diameter-based risk indices in a quasi-prospective patient cohort study. Methods: In total, 12 women and 31 men with intact AAAs at baseline have been selected retrospectively at two medical centers. Within 56 months, 19 cases ruptured, whereas 24 cases remained intact within 2 to 56 months. This outcome was kept confidential until all biomechanical activities in this study were finished. The biomechanical AAA rupture risk was calculated at baseline using high-fidelity and low-fidelity finite element method models. The capability of biomechanics-based and diameter-based risk indices to predict the known outcomes at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after baseline was validated. Besides common cohort statistics, the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curves has been used to grade the different rupture risk indices. Results: Up to 9 months ahead of rupture, the receiver operating characteristic analysis of biomechanics-based risk indices showed a higher AUC than diameter-based indices. Six months ahead of rupture, the largest difference was observed with an AUC of 0.878 for the high-fidelity biomechanical risk index, 0.859 for the low-fidelity biomechanical risk index, 0.789 for the diameter, and 0.821 for the sex-adjusted diameter. In predictions beyond 9 months, none of the risk indices proved to be superior. Conclusions: High-fidelity biomechanical modeling improves the predictability of AAA rupture. Asymptomatic AAA patients with high biomechanical AAA rupture risk indices have an increased risk of rupture. Integrating biomechanics-based diagnostic indices may significantly decrease the false-positive rate in AAA treatment. Clinical Relevance: Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the tenth leading cause of death in men older than 60 years, however, the currently used maximal diameter criterion has a high false-positive rate. In this study, we have compared this criterion with biomechanical rupture risk assessment on the unique data set of 43 asymptomatic AAAs, of which 19 ruptured later. Moreover, the AAA outcome was blinded to the operator for the first time. Our data demonstrated that the biomechanical rupture risk assessment is superior to maximal diameter in predicting AAA rupture up to 9 months ahead and significantly decreases the false-positive rate.

Allelic Variants for Candidate Nitrogen Fixation Genes Revealed by Sequencing in Red Clover (Trifolium pratense L.),"Plant-rhizobia symbiosis can activate key genes involved in regulating nodulation associated with biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Although the general molecular basis of the BNF process is frequently studied, little is known about its intraspecific variability and the characteristics of its allelic variants. This study's main goals were to describe phenotypic and genotypic variation in the context of nitrogen fixation in red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and identify variants in BNF candidate genes associated with BNF efficiency. Acetylene reduction assay validation was the criterion for selecting individual plants with particular BNF rates. Sequences in 86 key candidate genes were obtained by hybridization-based sequence capture target enrichment of plants with alternative phenotypes for nitrogen fixation. Two genes associated with BNF were identified: ethylene response factor required for nodule differentiation (EFD) and molybdate transporter 1 (MOT1). In addition, whole-genome population genotyping by double-digest restriction-site-associated sequencing (ddRADseq) was performed, and BNF was evaluated by the natural N-15 abundance method.

Cellular Response to Individual Components of the Platelet Concentrate,"Platelet concentrates and especially their further product platelet lysate, are widely used as a replacement for cell culturing. Platelets contain a broad spectrum of growth factors and bioactive molecules that affect cellular fate. However, the cellular response to individual components of the human platelet concentrate is still unclear. The aim of this study was to observe cellular behavior according to the individual components of platelet concentrates. The bioactive molecule content was determined. The cells were supplemented with a medium containing 8% (v/v) of platelet proteins in plasma, pure platelet proteins in deionized water, and pure plasma. The results showed a higher concentration of fibrinogen, albumin, insulin growth factor I (IGF-1), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), in the groups containing plasma. On the other hand, chemokine RANTES and platelet-derived growth factor bb (PDGF-bb), were higher in the groups containing platelet proteins. The groups containing both plasma and plasma proteins showed the most pronounced proliferation and viability of mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts. The platelet proteins alone were not sufficient to provide optimal cell growth and viability. A synergic effect of platelet proteins and plasma was observed. The data indicated the importance of plasma in platelet lysate for cell growth",10601.0,"Sovková, Věra:Vocetková, Karolína:Hedvičáková, Věra:Blahnová, Veronika:Buzgo, M.:Amler, E.:Filová, Eva",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0
Railway Ecology—Experiences and Examples in the Czech Republic,"The range of direct and indirect effects of railway transport on animals, plants, ecological processes and the actual ecosystems vary considerably. Railway transport operations and infrastructure building lead to environmental pollution, loss or conversion of habitats, landscape fragmentation and, last but not least, to animal mortality caused by collisions with passing trains. The impact of railways is determined by the nature of railway infrastructure, which is not as significant in the Czech Republic as road infrastructure, yet it is one of the densest in Europe. An important feature is relatively low electrification (about 33% of the lines) and the length of multi-track lines (about 20%). In the coming years, we can expect massive investments in revitalization, optimization and modernization of the railways in the Czech Republic, and eventually their electrification.

Subsidies and technical efficiency of Czech food processing industry,"At present, the New Common Agricultural Policy for the period 2021–2027 has been currently formulated. Future of the agriculture and food industry is now widely discussed. These sectors play an important role, and it is necessary to maintain their competitiveness and sustainability. In this context, the main aim of the paper is to evaluate the technical efficiency of food processing firms by using Stochastic Frontier Analysis applying True Fixed Effect model on production function. It was identified, that increase of subsidies cause a slight increase in the mean of technical inefficiency. Also, the technical efficiency of the firms without subsidies is higher than in the subsidised firms and differs statistically significantly in the time and also with respect to the region of the firm.

EMISSIONS OF FLUORINATED GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC FOR 1990–2015 PERIOD,"Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are anthropogenic gases, which are used as substitutes for ozone depleting substances. F-gases do not damage ozone layer but they contribute to the global warming. F-gases have a high global warming potential (GWP) and thus the use of F-gases should be controlled and regulated. The main legislative measure in European Union (EU), which regulates the use of F-gases, is Regulation 517/2014. The main goal of Regulation 517/2014 is to cut emissions of F-gases by 2/3 compared with 2014 levels.  As a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and as a member of EU, the Czech Republic is required to prepare and regularly update national greenhouse gas inventories, which include also emission estimates of F-gases. Emissions from sectors are estimated according to the methodology (IPCC 2006 Guidelines) prepared by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Total net emissions of the Czech Republic were 120 486.14 kt CO2 eq. in 2015 and the share of F-gases on total net emissions was 2.95%. Emissions are increasing yearly since 1990, when emissions of SF6 used in electronic equipment started to be estimated. The highest share on total net emissions of F-gases has their use in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, in which are mainly used blends containing hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Emissions of F-gases were 42 times higher in 2015 compared to 1990. Similar increase will be limited by regulation measures and thus the consumption of F-gas will be gradually decreasing and F-gases will be substituted by other chemicals.",10510.0,"Ondrušová, Beáta:Krtková, Eva",Meteorologické zprávy,4,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Toggle Toolkit: A Tool for Conducting Experiments in Unity Virtual Environments,"The article presents and offers Toggle Toolkit, which is an original collection of Unity scripts designed to control various aspects of interactive 3D experiments. The toolkit enables researchers in different fields to design, conduct and evaluate experiments and include interactive elements in immersive virtual environments. This was achieved by using the internal functionalities of the Unity engine as well as solutions of our own design. The structure of Toggle Toolkit allows triggers and toggles to be allocated to existing virtual objects and throughout the Unity scene. Once a trigger is executed (with a pre-described action, such as colliding with a virtual object, pressing a key, gazing at an object, etc.), the toggles associated with the trigger are activated and then change the attributes or behaviors of linked objects. All interactive behavior is logged and made available for further statistical analysis. Examples of applications in research are presented and discussed. The Toggle Toolkit’s utility lies in its simplicity and modularity. The Toolkit was designed especially for experimenters with low coding skills and high experimental customization design demands. It is available for free to be used in research and to be enriched with custom scripts. Video tutorial is provided to make it easier to start. The purpose of this paper is not only to give beginners an introduction to VR experimenting, but also to offer a deeper insight into its structure to more experienced developers potentially interested in utilizing and adjusting its features.",50103.0,"Ugwitz, Pavel:Šašinková, Alžběta:Šašinka, Čeněk:Stachoň, Zdeněk:Juřík, Vojtěch",Behavior Research Methods,4,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Prevention of accidents to storage tanks for liquid products used in agriculture,"The storage of liquid substances like livestock slurry, liquid fertilizer, digested material and many others is an integral part of farms. The storage is realized in tanks with a volume of several cubic meters up to several thousand cubic meters. Various materials such as steel, reinforced concrete, plastics and combinations of these materials are used to construct such containers, less often wood or composite materials. Compared to the chemical industry, the stored substances are not toxic to the human body, and in the event of accidents, only minimal damage to human health is usually caused. Hazardousness of stored substances consist of harmfulness to the environment, mainly due to the high concentration of these substances. In particular, water resources are threatened, both surface water and underground drinking water sources. In general, agriculture is often overlooked sectors. Despite that it is a crucial sector for human existence. As is the case with the safety of operation of technological equipment. In the field of chemical industry hundreds of publications have been written on this subject, in the field of agriculture, these publications are rather an exception. Employees working in the chemical industry are regularly trained to deal with emergencies, with employees in the agricultural sector this is an exception. It is clear from various reports that the accident is not avoided even in this sector. The authors collected a total of 241 records of accidents resulting in leakage of stored material from the tanks. Relative number of accidents causes by human error is 17%, organizational causes 20.7%, external causes 20.7%, and other causes 14.1%. Unknown causes were found in 27.4%. The data were statistically processed and selected emergency scenarios was described in more detail.

"Good Luck, Bad Luck: Ron Rash’s ""Cherokee""","The article analyzes Ron Rash’s short story “Cherokee,” in which good luck and bad luck play a prominent part. The author suggests that in this story Rash uses strategies known from the short fiction and essays of Flannery O’Connor and masterfully combines them with the existentialist reasoning of Walker Percy and his nineteenth-century Danish predecessor Søren Kierkegaard. The article illustrates how superstitions infiltrate the world of modern-day casinos, with their computerized slot machines, and explains the turning of a gambling experience into a mystical one. A miraculous win is interpreted as God’s grace that comes, totally unearned, to sinners, and is used in the story in accordance with O’Connor’s request for an entirely unexpected and yet believable development. The final part of the article, focusing primarily on the ambiguous ending of the story, explains, with the help of Percy’s and Kierkegaard’s ideas, that good luck automatically presupposes bad luck, exploring at the same time two basic paradoxes of human behavior: that people cannot bear other people’s good luck and that they feel alienated when everything in their own lives is fine, instead craving a change for the worse.",60206.0,"Arbeit, Marcel",Journal of The Short Story in English / Les Cahiers de la nouvelle,4,medium,high,0,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Complex Method for Estimation of Multiple Abiotic Hazards in Forest Ecosystems,"Forest ecosystems are faced with a variety of threats, including increasingly prolonged droughts and other abiotic stresses such as extreme high temperatures, very strong wind, invasive insect outbreaks, and the rapid spread of pathogens. The aim of the study was to define crucial abiotic stressors affecting Central Europe forest ecosystems and, with regard to their possible simultaneous effect, develop a universal method of multi-hazard evaluation. The method was then applied to the particular area of interest represented by part of the Czech Republic with forest land cover (12–19 ° E, 48–51 ° N). Based on National Threat Analysis, the most significant threats of natural origin with a close relationship to forest stability were identified as drought, high temperature, and wind gusts. Using suitable indicators, a level of their risk based on occurrence and consequences was estimated. The resulting combined level of risk, divided into five categories, was then spatially expressed on a grid map. The novelty of our paper lies in: (i) all relevant climatic data were combined and evaluated simultaneously with respect to the different level of risk, (ii) the developed methodological road map enables an application of the method for various conditions, and (iii) multiple hazards were estimated for the case study area.",10511.0,"Středová, Hana:Fukalová, Petra:Chuchma, Filip:Středa, Tomáš",Water,4,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Retrospective analysis of patient falls as a basis for evidence - based practice,"Abstract Aims: The aim of this work was to perform a five-year retrospective analysis of patient falls at the Regional University Hospital, as a basis for preventive programme implementation based on the evidence-based practice. Methods: The obtained data were processed by quantitative research methods. Descriptive statistics were obtained from patient fall report forms that were completed mandatorily over a five-year period. In the next phase, data correlation was performed, and areas in which the preventive anti-fall programmes are performed were determined at the significance level of 5%. The Stata of version 13 was used. The SPSS Answer Tree of version 3.1 was used to identify risk groups. Results: The Regional University Hospital is one of the largest healthcare facilities in the Czech Republic, with 1,729 beds and 4,480 employees. The analysis included a total of 2,280 patient falls that occurred over the fiveyear period. The data obtained by the descriptive statistics were correlated with the fall-risk area (chi-squared test). The statistically significant relationships seemed to be: year of monitoring, department, type of ward, age, mental condition, medication use, antipsychotics, cardiovascular drugs, diuretics, medication category, circumstances of fall, patient cooperation, patient mobility and post-fall development. Conclusion: The processing of patient fall incidence information as one of the most common adverse events in a hospital is relevant for national and transnational comparison.

Community Well-Being or Quality of Place? A Few Notes and Their Application in Czech Republic,"Community well-being is an umbrella term for different ways of describing community development. The combination of words community and well-being is a result of the application of the psychological term well-being to territorial planning, or generally, to a geographical context. This paper includes an analysis of the concept of well-being in its original psychological context, and an assessment of the suitability of its application in the form of community well-being. Quality of life, in our understanding, is based on the examination of a good life. In psychology and other sciences oriented towards the subjective dimension of quality of life, the attention is focused on `how` a person lives his/her life, on the other hand, in geography and other sciences oriented towards the objective dimension of quality of life, the attention is focused on `where` a person lives his/her life, i.e. the `place`. The key element of the geography of quality of life is the phenomenon of a `good place` as a place, where a good life is lived. The described approach provides a framework for the analysis of different-size groups of municipalities and small towns, using self-reported evaluations of the quality of life of their inhabitants.",50401.0,"Murgaš, František:Klobučník, Michal",New Dimensions in Community Well-Being,4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Turistika Activities and Games, Dramaturgy, and the Czech Outdoor Experience","This chapter provides an overview of the Czech outdoor experience involving specific indigenous approaches, the concept of turistika activities and the dramaturgy method of course design.

Turistika is often translated as 'tourism', but that begins the process of diluting something that is particularly culturally unique and specific to the Czech context and environment. The concept of risk in the dramaturgy approach is holistic in that it is inter disciplinary, considers the relationship between comfort and learning zones, and emotional, social, psychological and spiritual elements are considered equally important as physical risk in the planning process.

Changes in the availability of clinical practice guidelines for malnutrition: A 6-y multicenter study,"Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the availability of clinical practice guidelines for malnutrition in hospitals over a period of 6 y and the subsequent use of nutritional interventions in malnourished patients. Methods: This study was conducted as a secondary data analysis of data that were collected from 2012 to 2017 in a quantitative, cross-sectional, multicenter study called the National Prevalence Measurement Quality of Care (LPZ). Data from 15 hospitals and 5650 participating patients were analyzed. Results: The availability of clinical practice guidelines for malnutrition at the institutions increased from 6.7% in 2012 to 100% in 2017 (P &lt, 0.001). The control of compliance to the guidelines increased from 28.6% to 85.7% (P &lt, 0.001) and the documentation of malnutrition risk improved from 63.1% to 87.5% (P = 0.008). In 2017, the intervention &quot,&quot,referral to dietitian&quot,&quot, was used 8.3% more often (P &lt, 0.001). The number of patients who did not receive any intervention decreased from 70% in 2012 to 55.6% in 2017 (P &lt, 0.001). Conclusions: The availability of guidelines on malnutrition increased in participating hospitals over the 6-y study period. Regular controls of adherence to the guidelines positively correlated with their availability. More interventions to treat malnutrition were carried out in 2017. The use of clinical practice guidelines in this study was associated with more interventions treating malnutrition.",30307.0,"Blanař, Vít:Eglseer, Doris:Lohrmann, Christa:Hoedl, Manuela",Nutrition,4,low,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Past Developments and Current Advancements in Unsteady Pressure Measurements in Turbomachines,"The aim of this paper is to review, summarize, and record long-term experience with development and application of aerodynamic probes with built-in miniature pressure transducers for unsteady pressure measurement and industrial research in turbomachine components. The focus of the first half of the paper is on the work performed at VZLU Prague, Czech Republic (Secs. 3–8). The latest development in unsteady pressure measurement techniques and data reduction methodology suitable for future research in highly loaded, high-speed turbine engine components performed at NASA GRC Cleveland, OH, is reported in Secs. 8–15 of this paper.

An Overview of Problematic Features of English Phonology for Czech Learners of English,"As students of English can testify, English pronunciation is rarely given high priority, nor taught systematically in Czech EFL classrooms. Learners are immediately confronted with an array of phonological challenges within whole words. This has not always been the case. Comenius advocated the mapping of pronunciation and spelling “before all things”. While phonics has been returning to the L1 English language classroom, it has yet to become an integral part of L2 English language teaching. As an aid, particularly for Czech teachers of English, this article describes the problems which Czech speakers have with aspects of segmental phonology. Real life examples of phonological errors are given. Failure to teach good pronunciation, it is argued, does not only a disservice to today’s students who will be tomorrow’s teachers but to the next generation of learners too, their students. It is also suggested that modern teachers can apply timeless principles from the past to meet both present and future challenges.",0.0,"Karásková, Nicola",ELT Revisited.

P4-to-VHDL: Automatic Generation of 100 Gbps Packet Parsers,"Software Defined Networking and OpenFlow offer an elegant way to decouple network control plane from data plane. This decoupling has led to great innovation in the control plane, yet the data plane changes come at much slower pace, mainly due to the hard-wired implementation of network switches. The P4 language aims to overcome this obstacle by providing a description of a customized packet processing functionality for configurable switches. That enables a new generation of possibly heterogeneous networking hardware that can be runtime tailored for the needs of particular applications from various domains. In this paper we contribute to the idea of P4 by presenting design, analysis and experimental results of our packet parser generator. The generator converts a parse graph description of P4 to a synthetizable VHDL code suitable for FPGA implementation. Our results show that the generated circuit is able to parse 100 Gbps traffic with fairly complex protocol structure at line rate on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. The approach can be used not only in switches, but also in other appliances, such as application accelerators and smart NICs. We compare the generated output to a hand-written parser to show that the price for configurability is only a slightly larger and slower circuit.",0.0,"Benáček, Pavel:Kubátová, Hana:Puš, VP",2016 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM 2016),4,high,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Air Pollution Sources’ Contribution to PM2.5 Concentration in the Northeastern Part of the Czech Republic,"This article focuses on the source apportionment of air pollution in a specific northeastern part of the Czech Republic. The research area, located around the city of Třinec, is significantly affected by a complex spectrum of air pollution sources, including local residential heating (coal and wood burning), heavy industry (mainly iron and steel production), road traffic, and regional and long-range air pollution transport from the nearby cities, Poland, and other countries. The main pollution sources contributing to the total concentration of fine suspended particles (PM2.5) were evaluated on the basis of the measurements at three sites and on subsequent positive matrix factorization modeling. The six major air pollution factors were identified, and their relative and absolute contributions were quantified. The result of the study is that the most important current task of air protection is to reduce the residential emissions from solid fuels, which are responsible for approximately 50–60% of PM2.5 concentration, followed by the regional primary and secondary aerosol sources (up to 40% of the total PM2.5 aerosol mass). Lower contributions have been identified in the case of resuspended mineral and biogenic particles (15–20%), long-range (trans-European) air pollution transport (up to 10%), and heavy industry (up to 10% in the most affected location). A detailed discussion has been provided considering specific regional EC (elemental carbon)–OC (organic carbon) relations in the region with traditional coal-burning for household heating which complicate the interpretation of the PMF (Positive Matrix Factorization) results, especially due to the interference between the traffic, residential heating, and biogenic aerosol factors.",10511.0,"Seibert, Radim:Krejčí, Blanka:Volná, Vladimíra:Hladký, Daniel:Nikolová, Irina",Atmosphere,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Comparing metacognitive reading strategies among university students from Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic","Students’ uses of metacognitive reading strategies are an important part of effective learning during university studies. Universities may place varied emphasis on the use of different strategy types, and the students employ them accordingly. A purpose of this study was to examine the use of analytic and pragmatic reading strategies by university students from a cross-cultural perspective. Data were collected about students pursuing education study programmes in four Central European countries, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic (n = 2692), with the assumption of finding convergent results. Another purpose of this study was to examine the association between students’ ratings of the metacognitive reading strategies and their demographic and academic characteristics. The research instrument was the Metacognitive Reading Strategies Questionnaire translated into the national languages of students. Generally, the study confirmed similar results among the participating universities. The closest are the findings about the dominance of pragmatic metacognitive reading strategies over the analytic ones, no difference between the genders in the rating of analytic strategies and a female preference for pragmatic strategies. Other demographic and academic characteristics did not demonstrate such strong converging tendencies among universities in the rating of metacognitive learning strategies as gender, but they contributed in creating a complex picture of university students’ learning.",50302.0,"Gavora, Peter:Vaculíková, Jitka:Kalenda, Jan:Kálmán, O.:Gombos, P.:Świgost, M.:Bontová, A.",Journal of Further and Higher Education,4,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Short fatigue crack behaviour under low cycle fatigue regime,"This paper addresses the important issue of the description of short fatigue crack behaviour. It is typical for these cracks that they propagate under large scale yielding conditions at the crack tip, which means that the non-linear fracture mechanics has to be applied. This paper presents results of experiments designed to measure the short crack growth rates in five different materials – 316L steel, Eurofer 97 steel, ODS Eurofer steel, Duplex 2205 steel and Al 6082 alloy. The crack growth rates of these materials are described using different fracture mechanics parameters – the stress intensity factor, the J-integral and the plastic part of the J-integral. These approaches are evaluated and compared. The comparison revealed that the plastic part of the J-integral is the parameter governing the short crack growth rate in large scale yielding conditions. Moreover, crack growth rate data from all the tested materials measured at various loading levels lies on a unique curve. This remarkable observation suggests that the crack growth rate is determined by the extent of energy spent to plastic deformation, irrespective of the other materials properties.",20306.0,"Hutař, Pavel:Poduška, Jan:Šmíd, Miroslav:Kuběna, Ivo:Chlupová, Alice:Náhlík, Luboš:Polák, Jaroslav:Kruml, Tomáš",International Journal of Fatigue,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Doing Christian Social Ethics in the Czech Republic,"Christian social ethics in the Czech Republic is embedded within a highly secularized society. Since this society is mostly sceptical towards the Churches, but can nonetheless not be seen simply as atheistic, the dialogue that theological social ethics has with society is a specific challenge for theology in the Czech Republic. Christian social ethics is therefore faced with having to cross its own borders in several ways. I will focus in the first part of this article on the historical, social and ecclesial context. I will then present the current situation in teaching Christian social ethics at state universities, as well as the most relevant publications in Christian social ethics published in the Czech Republic since 1989.

Bolzano’s measurable numbers: are they real?,"During the early 1830's Bernard Bolzano, working in Prague, wrote a manuscript giving a foundational account of numbers and their properties. In the final section of his work he described what he called 'infinite number expressions' and 'measurable numbers'. This work was evidently an attempt to provide an improved proof of the sufficiency of the criterion usually known as the 'Cauchy criterion' for the convergence of an infinite sequence. Bolzano had in fact published this criterion four years earlier than Cauchy who, in his work of 1821, made no attempt at a proof. Any such proof required the construction or definition of real numbers and this, in essence, was what Bolzano achieved in his work on measurable numbers. It therefore pre-dates the well-known constructions of Dedekind, Cantor and many others by several decades. Bolzano's manuscript was partially published in 1962 and more fully published in 1976. We give an account of measurable numbers, the properties Bolzano proved about them, and the controversial reception they have prompted since their publication.",0.0,"Russ, S.:Trlifajová, Kateřina",Research in History and Philosophy of Mathematics,4,low,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Validity of the SDDS: A 40-item vocabulary screening tool for 18- to 42-month olds in Czech,"Background: Children with early language delays are at increased risk of persistent language impairment. Early identification and intervention are desirable. Parent-report inventories are useful screening tools, but the screening context places limits at their length. Validity of parentreport screening tools in languages other than English has been rarely reported in detail. Aims: The aim was to establish the concurrent validity of an existing 40-item parent-report vocabulary screening tool in Czech, using a picture-based examiner-administered comprehension and production task as a concurrent measure of vocabulary. Methods &amp, Procedures: Parents of 200 children aged 1,3 to 3,6 were given the screening inventory, in which they were asked if their child says or comprehends each of 40 words. At the same time, children were administered a picture-based comprehension and production task. Concurrent validity of the inventory was examined using correlations, partial correlations, and regression analyses controlling for age. Outcomes &amp, Results: The partial Spearman correlation (controlling for age) between production scores from parent-report and production scores from the examiner-administered task was 0.53, for comprehension, the correlation between parent report and test scores was 0.36. These values are similar to those reported for short and full versions of MacArthur-Bates CDI for 2-year-olds. Conclusion &amp, Implications: A 40-item tool shows clear concurrent relations with an examineradministered picture comprehension and production task. The study demonstrates that short parent-report tools may be useful in early identification of language impairments, and they may be a good option particularly in languages that have limited repertoire of assessment instruments.",50302.0,"Smolík, Filip:Bytešníková, Ilona",JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,4,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Efficiency of the Food Industry,"Owing to the change of system in the CEECs at the beginning of the 1990s and also to their simultaneous accession to the EU, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary have historical, political and economic similarities. This provided the opportunity to compare the effect of EU accession on the development and the current economic and financial situations of the food industries of the three countries. We used primarily data from the period 2003-2013 and, in order to identify differences and similarities, both quantitative and qualitative analyses were employed.  Our analysis covered the general state of the food industries of the three countries, including their position in the national economy, their output, revenues, employment and their main financial results. Using secondary sources, we also examined the main branches, including their state and contribution to the food industry. Besides statistical analysis were used qualitative information and the results of interviews with industry participants in order to go beyond the data to obtain the views of producers. We tried to assess the technological situation of the industry as it is very important to examine what machines, equipment and production methods the food industry uses and how modern it is. We also analysed the local and export market opportunities of the market players, their innovation capabilities, their employment, their business relationships and cooperation with other participants, and generally what problems they face in the market. In addition to the supply side we looked at the demand side because it is essential to examine the purchasing power of consumers. The study faced huge difficulties because the three research institutes use different methodologies and have access to different data. Moreover, they analyse the food industry according to different branches. The differences between the indicators used made it difficult to compare the three countries.

Our devised expression system is a context-dependent solution when it comes to investigating host-pathogen interactions under the modulated conditions of plant cytokinins.",10606.0,"Naseem, M.:Shams, S.:Roitsch, Thomas",Auxins and Cytokinins in Plant Biology,4,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Exploring the pathways of adaptation: avatar 3D animation procedures and virtual reality arenas in research of human courtship behaviour and sexual reactivity in psychological research,"There are many reasons for utilising 3D animation and virtual reality in sexuality research. Apart from providing a mean with which to (re)experience certain situations there are four main advantages: a) bespoke animated stimuli can be created and customized, which is especially important when researching paraphilia and sexual preferences, b) stimulus production is less expensive and easier to produce compared to real world stimuli, c) virtual reality allows us to capture data such as physiological reasons to stimuli, that we would not be able to otherwise (without resorting to self-report measures which are especially problematic in this research domain), d) ethical, legal, and health and safety issues are less complex since neither physical nor psychological harm is caused to animated characters allowing for the safe presentation of stimuli involving vulnerable targets. The animation sub-group has been exploring so far several production quality levels and various animation procedures in a number of available software. The aim is to develop static as well as dynamic, interactive sexual stimuli for sexual diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Estimation of economic weights for number of teats and sperm quality traits in pigs,"Accurate predictive modelling facilitates efficient and effective trait selection in animal breeding and can decrease costs while maximizing profits when raising economically important animals. The objective of this study was to extend a previously developed bioeconomic model and computer program to calculate the marginal economic values (MEVs) and economic weights (EWs) for direct and maternal pig traits affected by new reproductive traits, namely the number of sow functional teats (NFTs) and boar sperm quality traits (SQTs) that included sperm volume, sperm concentration, motility percentage and percentage of abnormal spermatozoa. The MEV of NFTs represented the cost differences between naturally and artificially reared piglets until weaning and the cost differences between naturally and artificially reared finished animals. The MEVs of SQTs expressed the saved costs for artificial insemination, assuming a decreased price per insemination dose when improving the SQTs. The absolute and relative EWs for the newly defined complex of traits in the breeding objectives for pig breeds involved in the Czech national three-way crossing system (Czech Large White [CLW], Czech Landrace [CL] and Pietrain [PN]) were calculated using gene flow methods. The NFT trait was included only for dam breeds, and the relative EW averaged 3.6% of the total economic importance based on the genetic standard deviations of all 19 simultaneously evaluated traits in CLW and CL breeds. The relative EWs of the four SQTs comprised 2.0% of the total economic importance of the 19 traits in the CLW and CL dam breeds and 8% of the total economic importance of the 18 traits in the PN sire breed. Therefore, inclusion of the NFTs for dam breeds and SQTs for sire breeds in the breeding goal is recommended to aid in obtaining ideal outcomes with optimal economic values.",40203.0,"Krupa, Emil:Wolfová, Marie:Krupová, Zuzana:Žáková, Eliška",Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What is Not in Grammar Books?,"Traditional grammar reference books usually list different kinds of finite and non-finite clauses and consider the functions these clauses perform in sentences. However, they do not usually point out that in written English both kinds of clauses are equally important and that learners of English should not only recognize and understand finite and non-finite clauses, but also produce them correctly. This paper contemplates the treatment of finite/non-finite clauses in a selection of grammar books. Moreover, it summarizes the results of diachronic research into written English which indicates that in contemporary English non-finite clauses are becoming increasingly prominent. The paper considers possible reasons for this developmental trend and argues that careful attention should be paid to these structures by the authors of books for advanced learners of English.",0.0,"Malá, Marcela",ELT Revisited :  Some Theoretical and Practical  Perspectives,4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Eye movements in viewing urban images and natural images in diverse vegetation periods,"The positive effect of viewing nature on cognitive function is explained in terms of perceptual fluency in the processing of nature scenes based on their fractal structure. The present study analyzed eye movements in viewing natural and urban scenes. Previous investigations found lower eye movement activity in viewing natural scenes compared to urban scenes. The first objective was to replicate previous findings from eye-tracking studies with a different set of images. The second objective was to analyze differences while viewing deciduous forest pictures in two vegetation periods. It was presumed that vegetation without foliage has a lower level of fractal complexity, which may result in differences in eye movements. Fifty-five undergraduates participated in the study. They viewed photographs of forests with foliage, forests without foliage, and urban scenes. Eye movements were recorded using a Tobii X2-60 eye tracker. The results revealed a significantly lower mean number of fixations in viewing natural scenes compared to urban scenes and a significantly lower mean number of fixations in viewing natural scenes with foliage compared to natural scenes without foliage. Moreover, natural scenes with foliage had significantly higher fractal dimensions than natural scenes without foliage and urban scenes. A lower number of fixations means a lower effort in processing visual information. Thus, the data showed a lower effort while observing natural scenes vs. urban scenes, as well as an association between eye movements and the fractal complexity of presented images. A higher fractal complexity was linked with lower eye movement activity. However, it is still unclear how the different visual complexity of vegetation with and without foliage can contribute to perceptual fluency in visual processing.",50101.0,"Franěk, Marek:Petružálek, Jan:Šefara, Denis",Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Political parties and the policy agenda,"Political parties are regarded as traditional cornerstones of everyday political life in liberal democracies. Their importance is generally acknowledged because they represent the people: the basic element of any democratic regime. It is also assumed that their function is primarily to aggregate and formulate demands on a political system, and thus to set the agenda by linking civil society and the state (cf. Katz and Mair, 1995). This role of political parties in policymaking and agenda setting is recognized in the policy literature but the issue of political parties themselves is rather neglected therein (for example, Anderson, 1997, Howlett, Ramesh, and Perl, 2009, Jones, 1970). Moreover, parties are mostly viewed from a narrow perspective that reduces them to unitary collective actors represented by the party leadership. This reduced perception has led to the underestimation of their role and influence in the policy process. It has also biased our understanding of the complexity of relations between political parties and agenda setting. This chapter aims to correct such a bias by offering a more complex perspective of the study of political parties and policy agendas. We argue that political parties should be considered not only from the angle of policy actors, but also from the angle of institutions. From this perspective, they represent arenas that link party-related actors and encompass party-related elements of political life (political ideology, election programs and so on) that both determine parties' goals and behavior. Thus, our overall aim is to give an overview of the debates and research positions in the area of political parties and policy agendas based on a literature review and our own experience researching political parties and policy relations (for example, Pola_ek et al., 2012, Pola_ek, Perottino, and Novotny, 2014).

Analysis of an Airfoil Using a Transition and Turbulence Model,"In order to evaluate the performance of airfoils with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools, modelling of transitional region in the boundary layer is very critical. Currently, there are several classes of transition-based turbulence model which are based on different methods. Among these, the k-kL- ω, which is a three equation turbulence model, is one of the prominent ones which is based on the concept of laminar kinetic energy. This model is phenomenological and has several advantageous features. Over the years, different researchers have attempted to modify the original version which was proposed by Walter and Cokljat in 2008 to enrich the modelling capability.

Circular thin-walled tube mortar specimens were subjected to pure torsional loading inducing anti-plane shear (mode III) fracture. The deformation of the specimen during loading was assessed on its curved surface using an optical measurement setup based on the digital image correlation technique. Modeling of shear fracture encompassed two sequential steps: i) a multiscale homogenization using continuum micromechanics was employed to upscale the elastic properties of the material based on a thorough microstructural characterization, followed by ii) a full structural simulation of the shear fracture using finite element analysis. The proposed methodology was successfully validated on two distinct loading cases and allows to link the microstructural composition to the structural behavior of the material.",20101.0,"Hlobil, Michal:Kunecký, Jiří:Koudelková, Veronika:Drdácký, Miloš",Construction and Building Materials,4,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The focus of the paper is on analysis of the behavior of the mobile user acting as a relay while considering a realistic locations of the receivers and transmitters on a standard mobile phone, more specifically with two photodetectors on both sides of a mobile phone and a transmitting LED array located upright. We also investigate dependency of the bit error rate (BER) performance on the azimuth and elevation angles of the mobile relay device within a typical office environment.

A new method for macrolide antibiotics determination in wastewaters from three different wastewater treatment plants,"An effective and practical method for the determination of macrolide antibiotics azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin in wastewater samples has been developed. The analytical method combines solid phase extraction followed by a chromatographic separation by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with an ion trap mass spectrometer utilizing the electrospray ionization technique. Detection of positively charged ions was performed in full scan mode from 500 to 900 m/z. The method detection limits and method quantification limits obtained were in the range of 2.03 – 7.59 ng L-1 and 6.08 – 23.84 ng L-1, respectively. Recoveries of solid phase extraction were obtained using SupelTM-Select HLB cartridges ranging from 85.76 % to 92.54 %. All target antibiotics were detected in 100 % of the collected raw influent samples with concentrations varying from 15 ng L-1 to 1849 ng L-1.

International Sharing Economy: the Case of AirBnB in the Czech Republic,"The concept of the sharing economy in accommodation business, an explosively growing business model, influences housing and hotel markets worldwide. The aim of this paper is to investigate the size of the AirBnB sector in Prague, to identify a potential disruption of the accommodation market and the potential scale of tax evasion of the AirBnB users, to state the need for additional regulation in this field. The research data were collected using the method of webscrapping from AirBnb website, then validated using the AirDNA database (18 586 units, 1 048 585 records, April 2016 to March 2017). The tax evasion was measured through authors' own model. The main results are as follows: through the offer of accommodation via AirBnB platform in Prague is extensive and compatible with the capacity of Prague hotels, the average occupancy rate in Prague is highly above the values of 14 largest European cities, 80% of the real estate units offered through the AirBnB platform do not represent the case of the usual sharing economy, but are a subject to taxes. The data on Prague substantially outstrips the European average, thus indicating to a potentially significant misuse of the AirBnB platform and a low-scale associated potential tax evasion. Czech legislation is well prepared for sharing economy. 7.4% of the AirBnB users control 39.56% of all accommodation options offered via this platform in Prague.",50204.0,"Ključnikov, Aleksandr:Krajčík, Vladimír:Vincúrová, Zuzana",Economics and Sociology,4,high,high,1,0,high,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Controlling the carbide formation and chromium depletion in W-Cr alloy during field assisted sintering,"Tungsten is a refractory metal, suitable for a broad range of high-temperature applications, due to its high melting point and high-temperature strength. Recently, tungsten alloys became of great interest in thermonuclear fusion research. The alloys maintain low sputtering yield and high melting point, but greatly improve some drawback properties comparing to pure tungsten. These alloys are commonly prepared by mechanical alloying and compacted using Spark Plasma Sintering/Field Assisted Sintering. Powder in a graphite die is consolidated by applying pulsed electric current and pressure. Graphite foil is commonly placed between the die and the powder, to prevent adhesion. However, for number of applications it is necessary to avoid carbon contamination. In the present study we have examined carbon contamination mechanism of W - 10 wt.%Cr - 1 wt.%Hf alloy during Field Assisted Sintering along with the alloy's properties. The experiments have shown that the graphite foil leads to significant dealloying via mechanism of liquid phase sintering. As a result, tailored properties of the material are deteriorated after several minutes of the consolidation process. Therefore, application of carbon diffusion barrier was proposed, examined and compared with the alloy sintered with graphite foil.",20501.0,"Vilémová, Monika:Lukáč, František:Veverka, Jakub:Illková, Ksenia:Matějíček, Jiří",International Journal of Refractory Metals & Hard Materials,4,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Between Implementing and Creating: Mothers of Children with Plurilingual Family Background and the Czech Republic’s Language Acquisition Policy,"The paper examines the language acquisition management cycle perpetuated by the state language acquisition policy in the Czech Republic and how it is dealt with in thematically oriented biographical interviews conducted with Czech mothers rearing children in families where multiple languages are used and transmitted. It analyses the discursive resources and narrative strategies used to construct biographical accounts in order to investigate the emic perspective on the micro-macro interplay of the language acquisition management cycle. Although the analysed narratives deal with experiences involving children with plurilingual family backgrounds, they seem to reproduce the discursive resources underpinned by the monolingual self-perception of Czech society. The analysis suggests that this is a result of comprehensive sense-making processes. On the one hand, mothers construct accounts of some of their activities in terms of the adjustment designs formulated on the macro level. On the other hand, some of them challenge the role of mere “implementers”, assigned to them within the language acquisition management cycle, through their narratives.",60203.0,"Özörencik, Helena:Hromadová, M.

Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised: Normative Data and Clinical Utility of Learning Indices in Parkinson’s Disease,"Introduction: The Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) is a frequently used visuospatial declarative memory test, but normative data in the Czech population are lacking. Moreover, the BVMT-R includes promising learning indexes that can be used to detect learning deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, its clinical usefulness has not yet been thoroughly examined. Early detection of memory impairment in PD is essential for effective treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to provide BVMT-R Czech normative data for clinical use and to find the detection potential of the principal BVMT-R scores, including new learning indices, to capture the cognitive deficit in PD.  Method: The BVMT-R were administered to a normative sample of 920 participants aged 17 to 95 years and to a clinical sample of 60 PD patients, 25 with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 35 with normal cognition (PD-NC). In order to provide normative values, multiple regression analyses were employed, and to compare the clinical and control sample, Bayesian Hierarchical Linear Models were used.  Results: The best model for regression-based norms showed to be with age + age2 + education + sex as predictors. From all learning indexes, L6 (sum of trials 1–3), followed by, L4 (sum of trials 1–3 multiplied by the difference between the highest and the lowest score) best differentiated between controls or PD-NC and PD-MCI.  Conclusions: We provide regression-based normative values for BVMT-R that could be used in clinical settings and meta-analytic efforts. Furthermore, we revealed visuospatial learning and memory deficit in PD-MCI. We have also identified the most discriminative learning index adapted to BVMT-R.",50103.0,"Havlík, Filip:Mana, Josef:Georgi, Hana:Bezdíček, Ondřej",Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Numerical prediction of the stratification performance in domestic hot water storage tanks,"An efficient storage retains thermal stratification and improves the discharging performance. Turbulent mixing between hot and cold water is the prime source of stratification destruction. In this paper quantification of turbulent missing was achieved on the basis of temperature profile, MIX number, and Richardson number. The evaluated parameters include flow rate, ΔT, and diffuser design, henceforth a direct interdependence between each was thus established. Various CFD models were developed and experimentally validated on the test rig in order to find the optimal working conditions in discharge mode. The results proved numerically that the tank working conditions can be optimized by proper selection of inlet device. For instance, slotted type inlet device sustained maximum stratification even in as adverse a condition as of turbulent inflow & low ΔT. Perforated and simple inlet devices were capable of delivering best discharge efficiency only at low flow rate of 200 l/h and were showing insignificant dependency on ΔT. However, as flow rate is increased, ΔT dependency increased. Seeing the compounded benefits of slotted inlet devices and decreased ΔT, it was concluded that slotted inlet device delivered comparatively better thermal performance at both adverse conditions i.e. high flow & low ΔT and high flow & high ΔT, however, failed to outshine the rest of the inlet devices at low flow rate & low ΔT, and low flow rate & high ΔT. These research findings can serve as guidelines to optimize the storage tank design – more specifically, inlet device based design integrated with heating system, as thermal stratification and COP of heating system – heat pumps, for example, are inherently correlated. Heat pumps are high flow rate and low ΔT devices, while, solar systems are low flow rate and high ΔT devices, Thus, opting for accurate choice of inlet device for a particular operating condition is critical.",20704.0,"Chandra, Yogender Pal:Matuška, Tomáš",Renewable Energy,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Stress changes and seismicity monitoring of hard coal longwall mining in high rockburst risk areas,"Rockburst represents a very dangerous phenomenon in deep underground mining as well as in underground constructions in unfavourable conditions (great depth, high horizontal stress, proximity of important tectonic structures, etc.). The rockburst problem relates to the natural and mining conditions of the rock mass. It is very difficult to decide which of the factors prevails, but we generally assume that it is the occurrence of competent rock layers in the rock mass. The destress blasting method is a very important rockburst control technique aims to competent rocks. The case study describes the control of rockburst risk by destress blasting in an example of a longwall of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. Monitoring of stress changes and induced seismicity was implemented in the selected longwall here and a description of these techniques is given. The paper describes the natural, geomechanical, and mining conditions of the investigated locality in detail. Stress changes ahead of the advancing longwall face as well as registered induced seismicity depending on the longwall advance are analysed, including the application of the destress blasting technique.

System for Deterministic Risk Assessment in Road Tunnels,"In this paper, a pragmatic and goal oriented system for risk analysis in road tunnels is described. It is particularly focusing on mortality risks in case of a road tunnel accident. It is a deterministic approach combining three major components: a) vehicle distribution in a tunnel, b) smoke propagation in case of a fire, and c) people evacuation (escape) component. The major improvement of this approach is in capturing the knowledge often provided only by experts into a robust and pragmatic system available to all decision makers. This is achieved through a large number of scenarios combining different configurations of road tunnels (e.g. different number of lanes, different speed limits) and the travel demand (e.g. different structure of the flow, different volumes of traffic) which were prepared and evaluated through microscopic traffic simulation. The resulting scenarios with the information about the number of vehicles in different tunnel sections were obtained. The results describe most of the existing tunnels and situations and can be used universally. Similarly, the people evacuation component can be evaluated in a general form. The results can be manually updated to suit any particular road tunnel which can differ for example by the availability or quality of warning and information systems. The remaining task is to create a physical model of the real tunnel and to model the smoke and fire propagation. All these components were combined into the CAPITA software that was developed as a part of the research project HADES (supported by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic). The CAPITA software is presented in the last chapter of this paper. The scenarios available off-line are in fact a knowledge base available to experts as well as decision makers and lead to a higher level of comprehension of the developments in case of fire and significantly speed up preparation of a risk analysis.",20104.0,"Přibyl, Ondřej:Přibyl, Pavel:Horák, Tomáš",Procedia Engineering,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is There a Link Between Financial Exclusion and Over-Indebtedness? Evidence from Czech Peripheral Municipalities,"This paper investigates the determinants of the over-indebtedness of inhabitants in particular municipalities in the Czech Republic. We draw on the theory of regional segmentation of financial markets, which foresees credit rationing in peripheral regions and empirically investigate the role that attractiveness of potential banking clients may play in the level of over-indebtedness in particular regions. We assume that regions with a higher concentration of non-bankable people suffer from a low concentration of bank services as the banks are not interested in serving people who do not meet their credit requirements. The findings from testing our empirical model indicate that regions with a higher level of non-bankable people have a higher concentration of over-indebted inhabitants. Our paper thus contributes to the nascent empirical verification of the theory of regional segmentation of financial markets. In conclusion, our policy recommendation - to support a socially-oriented financial industry, which could fulfil a niche in peripheral financial markets - could help in the battle against the pandemic of over-indebtedness and repossessions with its all negative consequences.",50202.0,"Chmelíková, Gabriela:Redlichová, Radka",Journal of Rural Studies,4,medium,high,0,0,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Self-organized Periodic Processes: From Macro-layers to Microworld of Diffusion and Down to the Quantum Aspects of Light,"Self-similarity and the orderly crystal (often dendritic) growth are an important parts of nature as well as the source of solid-state thermal chemistry under nonequilibrium (undercooling) conditions providing theoretical roots of chemical swinging clock. Such oscillation processes known in chemistry and biology apply for systems far from equilibrium involving special cases of oscillations extending from the selforganized periodic chemical reactions (such as Liesegang’s or Belousov–Zhabotinsky’s reactions) to ordered solid-state processes, from liquids to atmosphere, from macro to micro, indispensable in biology. The chapter deals with a remarkable problem of thermal physics, unresolved for more than 70 years, concerning class of diffusion-controlled periodic chemical reactions, where macroscopically observed diffusion action attains, with appreciable accuracy, the value of Planck’s quantum. Because the classical and quantum diffusions are processes, which are indistinguishable in the configuration space, a quantum criterion in terms of diffusion constants is valid. This criterion enables one to find out conditions under which the quantum behaviour of self-organized periodic reactions can be observed. Examples are shown for the subcritical and critical oscillatory regimes, a special kind of self-organized Liesegang’s rings—annual growth rings of a trunk of larch tree is discussed. The text even involves a thinkable hypothesis of the light self-organization based on the previously analysed principle on least time (Fermat) and of the least action (Maupertuis).

Production of polyhydroxyalkanoates on waste frying oil employing selected Halomonas strains,"The aim of this work was to study the potential of selected Halomonas species for conversion of waste frying oil into polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). In total nine Halomonas strains were experimentally screened for their capability of PHA production. Among them, Halomonas neptunia and Halomonas hydrothermalis were identified as potent PHA producers. Initial concentration of NaCl was identified as parameter influencing PHA yields as well as molecular weight of the polymer. In addition, H. hydrothermalis was capable of biosynthesis of a copolymer of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate P(3HB-co-3HV). When valerate was utilized as a precursor, the 3HV fraction in the copolymer reached high values of 50.15 mol.%. PHA production on lipid substrates by Halomonas has not been reported so far.

"Comparing DInSAR and PSI Techniques Employed to Sentinel-1 Data to Monitor Highway Stability: A Case Study of a Massive Dobkovičky Landslide, Czech Republic","Single-pair differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) as well as more advanced methods, such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), allow vertical displacements to be detected at the sub-centimeter level. Since 2014 free SAR data—Sentinel-1—have been collected systematically under the COPERNICUS program at a high temporal resolution and with global coverage. Such an open-access policy greatly helps build a wide user-community and develop diverse SAR-based applications. In this study conventional single-pair DInSAR and the PSI techniques were employed to monitor the vertical displacements of the newly constructed D8 highway, more specifically the part passing through the České Středohoří Mountains, where, during highway construction, a massive landslide occurred in June 2013. For both DInSAR and PSI, free Sentinel-1 radar data were used, moreover, the conventional single-pair DInSAR workflow was processed using freely available SNAP software. Results from the radar interferometry were validated using in situ techniques, such as geodetic measurements, 3D inclinometers, and laser scanning. Both approaches proved their ability to achieve reliable results in detecting vertical displacement “hotspots”. Additionally, in terms of absolute values, the PSI interferometry corresponds very well with the in situ measurements. This study also shows that open-source solutions (free data and SW) provided under the COPERNICUS program bring a great potential for monitoring vertical displacements.",20705.0,"Fárová, Kateřina:Jelének, Jan:Kycl, Petr:Strnadová, Veronika",Remote Sensing,4,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dedicated versus mainstreaming approaches in local climate plans in Europe,"Cities are gaining prominence committing to respond to the threat of climate change, e.g., by developing local climate plans or strategies. However, little is known regarding the approaches and processes of plan development and implementation, or the success and effectiveness of proposed measures. Mainstreaming is regarded as one approach associated with (implementation) success, but the extent of integration of local climate policies and plans in ongoing sectoral and/or development planning is unclear. This paper analyses 885 cities across the 28 European countries to create a first reference baseline on the degree of climate mainstreaming in local climate plans. This will help to compare the benefits of mainstreaming versus dedicated climate plans, looking at policy effectiveness and ultimately delivery of much needed climate change efforts at the city level. All core cities of the European Urban Audit sample were analyzed, and their local climate plans classified as dedicated or mainstreamed in other local policy initiatives. It was found that the degree of mainstreaming is low for mitigation (9% of reviewed cities, 12% of the identified plans) and somewhat higher for adaptation (10% of cities, 29% of plans). In particular horizontal mainstreaming is a major effort for local authorities, an effort that does not necessarily pay off in terms of success of action implementation. This study concludes that climate change issues in local municipalities are best tackled by either, developing a dedicated local climate plan in parallel to a mainstreamed plan or by subsequently developing first the dedicated and later a mainstreaming plan (joint or subsequent „dual track approach“). Cities that currently provide dedicated local climate plans (66% of cities for mitigation, 26% of cities for adaptation) may follow-up with a mainstreaming approach. This promises effective implementation of tangible climate actions as well as subsequent diffusion of climate issues into other local sector policies. The development of only broad sustainability or resilience strategies is seen as critical.",20704.0,"Reckien, D.:Salvia, R.:Pietrapertosa, F.:Simoes, S. G.:Olazabal, M.:Hurtado, S. D.

Atrial Septostomy for Left Ventricular Unloading During Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Cardiogenic Shock Animal Model,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to quantify and understand the unloading effect of percutaneous balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) in acute cardiogenic shock (CS) treated with venoarterial (VA) extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO). Background: In CS treated with VA ECMO, increased left ventricular (LV) afterload is observed that commonly interferes with myocardial recovery or even promotes further LV deterioration. Several techniques for LV unloading exist, but the optimal strategy and the actual extent of such procedures have not been fully disclosed. Methods: In a porcine model (n = 11, weight 56 kg [53-58 kg]), CS was induced by coronary artery balloon occlusion (57 minutes [53-64 minutes]). Then, a step-up VA ECMO protocol (40-80 mL/kg/min) was run before and after percutaneous BAS was performed. LV pressure-volume loops and multiple hemoglobin saturation data were evaluated. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess individual variable differences. Results: Immediately after BAS while on VA ECMO support, LV work decreased significantly: pressure-volume area, end-diastolic pressure, and stroke volume to TILDE OPERATOR+D9178% and end-systolic pressure to TILDE OPERATOR+D9186%, while superior vena cava and tissue oximetry did not change. During elevating VA ECMO support (40-80 mL/kg/min) with BAS vs without BAS, we observed 1) significantly less mechanical work increase (122% vs 172%), 2) no end-diastolic volume increase (100% vs 111%), and 3) a considerable increase in end-systolic pressure (134% vs 144%). Conclusions: In acute CS supported by VA ECMO, atrial septostomy is an effective LV unloading tool. LV pressure is a key component of LV work load, so whenever LV work reduction is a priority, arterial pressure should carefully be titrated low while maintaining organ perfusion.",30201.0,"Mlček, Mikuláš:Meani, Paolo:Cotza, Mauro:Kowalewski, Mariusz:Raffa, Giuseppe Maria:Kuriščák, Eduard:Popková, Michaela:Pilato, Michele:Arcadipane, Antonio:Ranucci, Marco:Lorusso, Roberto:Bělohlávek, Jan",JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions,4,low,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

RF/Microwave Applications of Memristors,"Memristor-based technology could be utilized, potentially, to enhance performance of many RF/microwave subsystems. Application of memristors in RF/microwave circuits, and in a broader context in electromagnetic systems, is another challenging field for researchers and engineers. In this application frontier, the research efforts might be divided, for example, into the following important classes of applications: (1) frequency selective surface, reconfigurable planar absorber, (2) reconfigurable antenna, direct antenna modulation, (3) RF/microwave filter, split-ring resonator filter, hairpin-line filter, capacitively coupled resonator filter, quasi-Gaussian lossy filter, (4) Wilkinson power divider. Memristors could be exploited as linear resistors with programmable resistance, which can be accurately adjusted to a desired or specified value. Precise controllability of the memristance value might be important for tuning microwave circuits and optimizing their performance. In several applications, such as filters, the high-frequency range of the operation enforces the memristor into the role of a linear resistor whose resistance can be adjusted electronically. On the other hand, some applications, such as reconfigurable electromagnetic absorbers, benefit from memristors as electromagnetic switches. Due to the unavailability of commercial memristors, it is necessary to use accurate circuit-level simulations for experimenting with the memristor-based RF/microwave circuits and for studying their performance. RF/microwave circuit simulators, which use the HSPICE engine for the time-domain transient simulation, such as NI AWR Microwave Office, can be used to verify the expected functionality of the considered memristor-based circuits.",20201.0,"Potrebič, Milka:Tošič, Dejan:Biolek, Dalibor","Advances in Memristors, Memristive Devices and Systems",4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Glass Fibers: Plasma Modification for Improved Interfacial Adhesion,"Plasma surface modification of glass fibers is an alternative technology to wet chemical processes employed for commercial sizing used for glass fiber-reinforced polymer composites. The sizing (functional coating) must improve compatibility and form a strong but tough link between the fiber and the polymer matrix. However, commercial sizing is a heterogeneous coating of variable thickness, with only a small portion of the total sizing chemically bonded to the fiber surface. In addition, the bonding is hydrolytically unstable. Plasma modification of glass fibers enables the deposition of a homogeneous film (interlayer) of controlled thickness and controlled chemical, mechanical, and surface properties. The ability to control the elemental composition, chemical structure (functional groups), wettability, surface roughness, interfacial adhesion, and Young’s modulus of deposited films in relatively wide ranges allows optimization of the interlayer for a specific composite system, i.e., the fiber and the matrix. With improved interfacial adhesion and higher cross-linking of the plasma polymer network, the plasma coatings have greater hydrolytic stability compared to commercial sizing. Optimized plasma modification of glass fibers (GF) enabled a 32% increase in the shear strength of GF/polyester composite compared to commercially sized fibers. Plasma modification is a prospective technology for the construction of more complex film nanostructures, such as the multilayer and gradient interlayers required for the novel conception of composites without interfaces.",0.0,"Čech, Vladimír",Encyclopedia of Plasma Technology,4,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Gender-related differences observed among immune cells in synovial fluid in knee osteoarthritis,"Objective: There is no existing comprehensive report on the cellular composition of synovial fluids (SFs) from knee osteoarthritis (OA). We therefore aimed to characterise the immune cell composition in SFs from knee OA (KOA) and in subgroups according to gender. Design: The immunophenotyping of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells, T and B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, dendritic and mast cells (MC) present in SFs from 53 patients (24 males/29 females) with KOA was performed using 6-colour flow cytometry. Results: SFs from patients with OA contained 90% hematopoietic cells. Lymphocytes were the predominant cell population (44.8%) in the SFs of OA patients, with CD4(+) T lymphocytes being more prevalent than CD8(+) T cells (CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio = 1.3). Within the monocyte/macrophage lineage gating, monocytes accounted for 33.9%, macrophages 14.8%, myeloid dendritic cells 16.4%. The rest of the hematopoietic cells were comprised of neutrophils (8%), NK cells (3.8%), T regulatory cells (1.2%), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (1.1%), mast cells (0.3%). In OA females, a higher percentage of CD4(+) T cells (P = 0.023), macrophages (P = 0.012), and a lower percentage of monocytes (P = 0.008) and CD8(+) T cells (P = 0.002) were detected in comparison to OA males. Conclusions: Based on the immune cell composition of SFs, data mining analysis revealed distinct phenotypes (monocyte-and lymphocyte-predominant) within each gender group. This first study on the cellular complexity of SFs in KOA showed marked differences between male and female patients.

Performance measurement in a transitional economy: unfolding a case of KPIs,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper aims to make contributions to the debate on “performance measurement in practice” focussing on how organisational participants respond to the “new regime” of key performance indicators (KPIs) and whether KPIs materialise as intended in a transitional economy. Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by the epistemological instruction of Schatzki&apos,s practice theory, this paper draws on qualitative data collected through face-to-face interviews, observations and documentary analysis of a single organisation. Findings: KPIs were introduced at PK (a manufacturing concern in Czech Republic) but widely seen as contradictory, inconsequential, top-down and unrealistic. These lead organisational participants to adopt a pragmatic approach towards PM embracing KPIs&apos, subjective assessment and manipulation, common sense or doing the job as given, and superficial compliance (symbolism). Research limitations/implications: The paper would be interesting to researchers because of its explanation of performance measurement practice in a distinct empirical setting, for its application of a practice theory inspired by Schatzki, and for inspiring new research agendas in transitional economies. Practical implications: The paper recommends the mobilisation of artefacts, such as various forms of bottom-up discussions, to encourage interactions between organisational members and influence individual beliefs and practical understandings of the intended managerial projects. Originality/value: The paper has focussed on organisations of practice to unravel the doings of organisational participants to explore the micro-processes of PM which otherwise would have been ignored. These doings and sayings, linked by pools of understanding, rules or instructions, and a teleoaffective structure, enabled the authors to unmask inherent tensions and contradictions in a new regime of performance measures such as KPIs.",50205.0,"Uddin, Shahzad:Popesko, Boris:Papadaki, Šárka:Wagner, Jaroslav","Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal",4,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

We demonstrate that the addition of nitrogen to the deposition process leads to a substantial enhancement in the abundance of nitrogen-containing functional groups in the resulting coatings as well as to the significant changes in their swelling and dissolution. These variations were found to result in different impregnation and release capabilities of the produced coatings:an almost 5 times higher amount of released antibiotics was observed for the samples prepared in nitrogen-rich atmosphere when compared to films deposited in pure argon.

The notion of the L-complete propelattice was introduced in connection with the fuzzified more famous variant of Tarski&apos,s theorem for a single L-fuzzy isotone map, whose main part holds even without the assumption of any version of transitivity. These results are here extended also to the concept of the so-called L-fuzzy relatively isotone maps and then additionally compared to the results, which are achieved for the generalized theorem and which always need a relevant version of transitivity. Wherever it is possible, facts and differences between both the theorems are demonstrated by appropriate examples or counterexamples.",10101.0,"Včelař, František:Pátíková, Zuzana",Fuzzy Sets and Systems,4,medium,high,1,0,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Digitized Image Analysis of Insula Echogenicity Detected by TCS-MR Fusion Imaging in Wilson's and Early-Onset Parkinson's Diseases,"Transcranial sonography (TCS) can reveal pathology in brain structures including insula. This study compared insula echogenicity among 22 patients with Wilson's disease (WD), 21 patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease (EO-PD) and 24 healthy patients. Echogenicity of predefined brain structures (insula, lentiform nucleus, caudate nucleus, substantia nigra and raphe nuclei) was evaluated using digitized analysis of TCS fusion imaging with magnetic resonance. Cortical, subcortical and cerebellar atrophy and ventricle diameters were determined from magnetic resonance images. The mean echogenicity index of insula did not differ between males and females (p = 0.92), but the echogenicity of insula was higher in patients with WD than in patients with EO-PD and healthy patients (p &lt, 0.05). The substantia nigra echogenicity was higher in patients with EO-PD, and lentiform nucleus echogenicity was higher in patients with WD (p &lt, 0.05). The echogenicity of insula correlated with lentiform nucleus echogenicity (r = 0.75) but not with age (r = -0.14), disease duration (r = -0.36), symptom severity (r = 0.28), cortical (r = 0.11) nor subcortical (r = 0.05) atrophy.",20600.0,"Školoudík, David:Mašková, Jana:Dušek, Petr:Blahuta, Jiří:Soukup, Tomáš:Burgetová, Andrea:Bártová, Petra",Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology,4,low,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The role of flavonoids in autoimmune diseases: Therapeutic updates,"Flavonoids are natural polyphenolic compounds which are included in a panoply of drugs and used to treat and/or manage human ailments such as metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological disorders and cancer. Thus, the purpose of this review is to emphasize the importance of flavonoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and put into the limelight of the scientific community several health-promoting effects of flavonoids which could be beneficial for the development of novel drugs from natural products. Despite available reviews on flavonoids targeting various disease conditions, a comprehensive review of flavonoids for autoimmune diseases is still lacking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to review the potential of flavonoids for autoimmune diseases. The structure-activity relationship of flavonoids in this review revealed that the rearrangement and introduction of other functional groups into the basic skeleton of flavonoids might lead to the development of new drugs which will be helpful in relieving the painful symptoms of various autoimmune diseases.

"Regional variations of traditional folk houses plaster pigments in South East and Central Moravia, Czech Republic","Colouring of folk buildings, its variations in time and sorts of pigments used have not been given enough attention in the area of interest so far. The article is the result of interdisciplinary study of ethnology and geology. It is based on a comparison of available material of ethnographic origin, which is based on a thorough analysis of published written material and an extensive literature search dealing with the color scheme of traditional buildings. An essential part was field research focused on sampling of used plasters. The article presents the results of the study of twenty four interior and exterior colored plasters taken from six buildings in the localities of two Moravian ethnographic areas. The basic methods of material analyzes were optical polarizing microscopy, powder X-ray diffractometers and Raman spectroscopy. The results show that all studied blue plasters are stained with ultramarine, dark red shades with ferric pigments of industrial origin (so-called ferric dusters) and yellow one by ochre. The deep green was due to organic synthetic pigment, whereas the lighter shades due to green earth, a natural glauconite clay in these cases. Based on the analyzed sample, no qualitative differences were found in the composition of pigments of folk buildings in south-eastern and central Moravia. Based on the examined set of samples, no qualitative difference in the composition of pigments were found between South East and Central Moravia.

Where is the speech that matters? On the silence of the czech theatre professionals in a crisis,"The essay presents the thesis that despite their activist tradition, Czech theatres abandoned any social criticism during the COVID-19 pandemic because they were unable to speak publicly about the structural conditions of the crisis (overtourism, mobility, etc.) and possibilities for change. The author argues that it is because the language of theatre professionals is nowadays shallow and clichéd and serves rather as a strategy to secure the positions in the artistic field than the true speech capable of addressing the public. This situation is interpreted in terms of neoliberalism/capitalist realism (Mark Fisher) producing the pragmatic language incapable of imagination and transformation. The intellectuals' speech of transcendentals (detached from the reality) is contrasted with true speech (Martin Buber, François Laruelle) originating in immanence. The artists are depicted as the keepers of personal, archetypal language capable of producing universal (""terrestrial"" - Bruno Latour) images of utopia.

Therefore, experiments were also carried out with the pure components and the influence of P2O5 on clinker phase composition in the absence of one of the main clinker oxide (Fe2O3 and Al2O3)was examined.

Surface Nanostructuring of Biopolymers for Tissue Engineering,"Surface modification of solid state materials, such as biopolymers, is a process that alters surface of a material resulting in changes in physical, chemical and biological properties. Many techniques of surface treatment have been developed to improve biopolymer properties, such as wet techniques, plasma exposure or laser treatment. Alternatively, the biopolymer surface can be deposited with metal nanostructures or consequently heated with application of bioactive substances, such as amino-acids or nanoparticles from solution. The methods for biopolymers treatment, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(hydroxybutyrate), poly(glycolic acid), polycaprolactone (PCL) and their blends or copolymers or fibrous polymers such as cellulose or chitosan can significantly alter theirs cytocompatibility or antimicrobial properties, on contrary.

Stratification analysis of domestic hot water storage tanks: A comprehensive review,"To assure high quality thermal storage and high efficiency of its acquisition, thermal stratification is often employed in domestic hot water tanks. The whole motivation of stratification lies in the fact that mixing effect can be minimized during operational cycle of the tank so that high temperature water could be taken at the load end, thus maintaining high thermal efficiency at demand side, while low-temperature water can be drawn at lower bottom, thus maintaining the high efficiency at energy collection side. The study of stratification entails the assessment of a wide variety of concepts to be embodied around the central theme of the tank –its design and modelling. This paper presents a systematic review pertaining to various such concepts . For instance, multi-node and plug-flow approach to model various temperature distribution models are considered. These models are categorized in paper as linear, stepped, continuous- linear and general three-zone temperature distribution models. Subsequently, the dynamics of thermo- cline decay and influencing parameters both during standby and dynamic mode will be demonstrated. In addition, a survey of state of the art methods and practices to ascertain the performance improvement and its quantification will be illustrated. This includes geometrical parameters –such as, structural design incorporation, essentially –inlet design, tank aspect ratio and wall material specification, and also, oper- ational parameters to curb down the inlet mixing.

The Prediction Capabilities of Bankruptcy Models in a Different Environment: An example of the Altman Model under the Conditions in the Visegrad Group Countries,"This paper presents the results of research into the discrimination capability of the Altman bankruptcy model. The authors are contributing in this way to discussion of the possible transferability of models that have been created in a different environment or a different time period. Efforts at model transfer are motivated by an assumption to obtain the same or similar discrimination accuracy for the given model as that declared by its creators. The tests performed have clearly shown that the discrimination accuracy of a model falls significantly when it is used in a different environment. This led in turn to an investigation of ways in which the discrimination capability of a model may be increased by means of the determination of new weightings for model variables and grey-zone boundaries.

"Incidence, treatment strategies and outcomes of acute coronary syndrome with and without ongoing myocardial ischaemia","BACKGROUND: Patients with acute coronary syndrome with signs of ongoing myocardial ischaemia at first medical contact should be indicated for immediate invasive treatment. AIM: To assess the incidence, treatment strategies and outcomes of acute coronary syndrome in a large unselected cohort of patients with respect to the signs of ongoing myocardial ischaemia. METHODS: The CZECH-3 registry included 1754 consecutive patients admitted for suspected acute coronary syndrome to 43 hospitals during a 2-month period in the autumn of 2015. Acute coronary syndrome with ongoing myocardial ischaemia was defined by the presence of persistent/recurrent chest pain/dyspnoea and at least one of the following: persistent ST-segment elevation or depression, bundle branch block, haemodynamic or electric instability due to suspected ischaemia. Major adverse cardiac events (death, reinfarction, stroke, unexpected revascularisation, stent thrombosis) and severe bleeding according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria were evaluated at 30 days. RESULTS: Acute coronary syndrome was ruled out during the hospital stay in 434 (24.7%) patients. Out of 1280 patients with confirmed acute coronary syndrome, 732 (57%) had clinical signs of ongoing myocardial ischaemia at first medical contact. Coronary angiography was performed in 94.7% of patients with confirmed acute coronary syndrome with ongoing myocardial ischaemia and 89% of patients with confirmed acute coronary syndrome without ongoing myocardial ischaemia ( P<0.001). The major adverse cardiac event rate was 9.8% for patients with confirmed acute coronary syndrome with ongoing myocardial ischaemia and 5.5% for patients without ongoing myocardial ischaemia ( P=0.005), the 30-day severe bleeding rate was 1.6% and 1.5% ( P=1.0). Patients with ongoing myocardial ischaemia admitted to regional hospitals had higher major adverse cardiac event rates compared with patients admitted directly to cardiocentres with percutaneous coronary intervention capability (13.3% vs. 8.2%, P=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing myocardial ischaemia was present in more than half of patients hospitalised with acute coronary syndrome.

"Common wintering of black kites (Milvus migrans migrans) in Greece, and new data on their wintering elsewhere in Europe","Black kites of the nominal subspecies Milvus migrans migrans breed in the Western Palearctic and in Central Asia, while the European population is relatively small. The birds winter mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Until 2000 winter observations of black kites were rare in Greece, and also within the tri-point border area of Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. At that time regular wintering of black kites started there.

Negotiating public space in a shopping mall,"Public space has been described as a contested space, which is also manifested in its many different conceptualisations. This chapter concentrates on what has been called the semi-public space: a space with an ambiguous status, used publicly, yet, at the same time, heavily controlled and influenced by private interests. The review will focus on shopping malls, which have become iconic semi-public spaces both by their media prominence and academic attention directed to them, and by their popularity in the everyday use of urban populations. The aim of this chapter is to study social control as a phenomenon which contributes to this popularity, identifying three categories of social control and discussing their contribution to the way shopping malls are presented by their management.",50401.0,"Pospěch, Pavel",Public space : between reimagination and occupation,4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Key Features of Genomic Imprinting during Mammalian Spermatogenesis: Perspectives for Human assisted Reproductive Therapy: A Review,"Increasing influence of epigenetics is obvious in all medical fields including reproductive medicine. Epigenetic alterations of the genome and associated post-translational modifications of DNA binding histones equally impact gamete development and maturation, as well as embryogenesis. Relationships between methylation and acetylation of histones and involvement of DNA methylation are important not only for chromatin remodelling but also significant to gene imprinting and thus affecting the gene expression in the embryo. Therefore, gene silencing accompanied with methylation of histones and DNA is a result of heterochromatin establishment in haploid male germ cell, the spermatid. Complex epigenetic changes leading to the establishment of histone code and heterochromatin are regulated by a broad range of factors, such as histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, non-coding RNAs, and small protein modifiers ubiquitin and SUMO. These factors are candidate diagnostic targets for reproductive medicine when anomalous gene imprinting or histone modification of the gametes may disrupt embryo development or cause developmental disorders in the offspring. Using advanced non-invasive techniques for sperm selection based on testing of epigenetic markers is a possible approach to more successful assisted reproductive therapy (ART) as well as prevention of epigenetic-origin disorders in ART babies.",0.0,"Štiavnická, Miriama:García Alvarez, Olga:Nevoral, Jan:Králíčková, Milena:Peter, Sutovsky","Anatomy &amp, Physiology: Current Research",4,medium,high,1,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Simultaneous use of the financial literacy level and the financial inclusion degree as a result of financial education efficiency in Visegrad Group countries,"The appropriate level of financial knowledge and the degree of financial integration needed in today?s financialized world. This paper studies the level of financial literacy and the degree of financial inclusion among the students who study economic fields. These students are a special target group ? very important for future development of financial markets. They are not only the future participants, but also the potential animators and creators of the financial market as well as the future financial advisors. The research sample comes from Visegrad Group countries (4V Countries), as the representatives from Central and Eastern Europe countries, where the level of financial literacy and degree of financial inclusion seems to be lower in comparison to the West European Countries. The research also contributes to knowledge in the area of expanding the methods of assessments of efficiency of financial education. The Authors decided to verify the new assessment of effectiveness of financial education. It will be conducted by a separate and simultaneous assessment of financial literacy and financial inclusion. The main results of research confirm the very low level of financial literacy and financial inclusion of young future economists in 4V Countries in both groups: starting and finishing the professional financial education. In addition, examining the degree of financial inclusion among the students who at the same time are educated at the basic level confirms the much lower level of informed financial inclusion.",50206.0,"Frączek, Bożena:Bobenič Hintošová, Aneta:Bačová, Monika:Siviček, Tomáš",Journal of Economics and Management,4,low,low,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Impact of Rumours Related to Political and Macroeconomic Uncertainty on IPO Success: Evidence from a Qualitative Model,"This article is dedicated to the propagation of rumours in regard to political and macroeconomic uncertainty related to a going public strategy. Rumours might have an enormous impact on the decision making of market participants due to information asymmetry and thus can explain the timevarying character in volumes of initial public offerings. We model the relation between political uncertainty and firms’ financing decisions while applying the SIRaRu rumour propagation model investigating the dynamics of the rumour spreading in complex social networks. We document how the IPO activity is adversely affected if confounding announcements in regard to political uncertainty are spread. Some realistic conditions on previous rumour spreading models are supplemented and a new qualitative on trends-based model is derived.

Spectral and temporal characteristics of Czech vowels in spontaneous speech,"This paper provides a comprehensive account of spectral and durational characteristics of Czech monophthongal vowels. It improves on the existing literature (that almost exclusively focused on read speech) in that it examines vowels in spontaneous speech recorded from 10 men and 10 women, who were recruited from the general population not restricted to students or media reporters (which were the populations used in previous studies). The present material thus represents a relatively naturalistic data set. The acoustical analyses of vowel spectral properties are not limited to only the first and the second formant (F1 and F2) but include also higher formants. Duration normalized for word length as well as long/short duration ratios are compared across all vowel qualities. In line with previous acoustic data on Czech high front vowels, the present results confirm that the phonologically short /ɪ/ is realized with a higher F1 than the phonologically long /iː/. The results further demonstrate that the mid front /ɛ/ and /ɛː/ are realized with a relatively high F1 and are numerically even closer to the low /a/ and /aː/ than to the other mid vowel quality, the back /o/ and /oː/. A novel finding is that short back vowels /o/ and /u/ have a higher F2 than their long counterparts: this slight fronting is likely attributable to the spontaneous style of speech as well as to the mostly coronal context in which the vowels were embedded. In contrary to recent literature that reported extremely low long/short ratios in high vowels our findings show that duration marks the phonological length distinctions consistently across all five vowel pairs: long vowels are on average 1.76 times longer than short vowels. The study concludes with a discussion of the implications that the vowel acoustic properties may have on the way the Czech vocalic system is transcribed.",60203.0,"Paillereau, Nikola:Chládková, Kateřina",Acta Universitatis Carolinae.

Undersampled-based Modulation Schemes  for Optical Camera Communications,"Widespread use of white light-emitting diodes and ubiquitous smart devices offer the opportunity to establish visible light communications (VLC) which has become a hot research topic based on the growing number of publications over the last decade. Camera-based VLC, namely optical camera communications (OCC), provide many unique features when compared with a single photodiode-based system, such as the ability to separate incident light in spatial and color domains. OCC technology represents a promising approach to utilize the benefits of VLC in beyond-5G scenarios and is one of the key technologies of the Internet of Things. Establishing a long communication channel in OCC, as well as non-flickering illumination in using low-frame-rate camera detectors, requires special modulation schemes. This article provides an overview of the principles of three categories of modulation schemes for OCC systems using a low-frame-rate camera detector. In addition, a series of undersampled modulation schemes are proposed and discussed to achieve flicker-free OCC with higher spectral efficiency. In addition, framing structures are designed to solve problems occurring in OCC systems using particular modulation schemes. To evaluate the performance of these modulation schemes, measured bit error rate values are shown. Finally, challenges in the implementation of OCC systems are also outlined.",20202.0,"Luo, P.:Zhang, M.:Ghassemlooy, Z.:Zvánovec, Stanislav:Feng, S.:Zhang, P.",IEEE Communications Magazine,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Comparison of three focus sensors for optical topography measurement of rough surfaces,"The study compares three variants of focus sensors designed for the optical topography measurement of rough surface specimens with submicron accuracy. We present a theoretical analysis of the focus sensor principles and the experimental measurements with a single point laser probe. A low coherent illumination beam was provided by a monochromatic laser source and a rotating diffuser, which reduced the speckles generated by the rough surface. The reflected beam was modulated by three specific optical elements (axicon, double wedge prism, four spherical lenses) realized by a spatial light modulator. A digital camera detected the output intensity patterns that were evaluated by the intensity centroid method. The results showed a good coincidence of the surface profiles obtained by the three sensor variants with the root-mean-square deviations below one micron.

"Exploring Synergy between Communications, Caching, and Computing in 5G-Grade Deployments","Decisive progress in 5G mobile technology, fueled by a rapid proliferation of computation-hungry and delay-sensitive services, puts economic pressure on the research community to rethink the fundamentals of underlying networking architectures. Along these lines, the first half of this article offers a first-hand tutorial on the most recent advances in content-centric networking, emerging user applications, as well as enabling system architectures. We establish that while significant progress has been made along the individual vectors of communications, caching, and computing, together with some promising steps in proposing hybrid functionalities, the ultimate synergy behind a fully integrated solution is not nearly well understood. Against this background, the second half of this work carefully brings into perspective additional important factors, such as user mobility patterns, aggressive application requirements, and associated operator deployment capabilities, to conduct comprehensive system-level analysis.

Significance of family caregivers today,"Family care is defined as an informal type of lay care that is based on the principles of solidarity and love for the next of kin. The significance of this type of care is currently rising among the elderly in connection with the rising demographic increase in the number of older adults. Care for the elderly within families has a number of benefits, but there are also drawbacks that need to be eliminated. The major benefit for the elderly is being able to live at home in a stress-free environment. The major drawbacks lie in the physical and psychological strain for the caregiver, the financial burden for the family, a disrupted cohabitation, and disrupted relationships between the care provider, the care recipient and the family. Consequently, state social and health policy should support family care not only financially with available services, but also with moral appreciation. The system is still recipient-oriented rather than focusing on the family caregiver. Support for family caregivers has a positive effect, namely in long-term care on the overall health of the older person, as well as on the national economy. The information obtained was gathered from electronic databases: EBSCO, PubMed, BMČ, Google Scholar, etc. The inclusion criteria for the theoretical overview was a search period of 2005-2015 and availability of full texts.

Aeroelastic instability of paper sheet in an offset printing press,"A simplified and efficient computational model of a thin flexible plate coupled to one-sided axial narrow-channel airflow is presented, modeling flow-induced vibration of a paper sheet transported by short pulses of compressed air encountered in the infeed system of offset printing press machines. The mathematical model is based on a discrete chain of masses, torsional springs, dampers andmassless rigid rods. The linearized equations of motion coupled to inviscid flowequations are derived and solved analytically in frequency domain. The structural model is validated on the case of bending of a clamped-free beam under gravity and the elastic and damping constants are identified from measurements. Aeroelastic instability is investigated for three fluidto-solid mass ratios ranging between 0.24 and 1.4, corresponding to three types of paper used in real offset printing machines.

Plant Cell Wall: A Simple Physical Barrier or a Complex Defense Modulator – Exploring Its Dynamic Role at Plant-Fungus Interface,"Plants are continuously threatened by many pathogens, among which fungal pathogen accounts for a measureable large quantity. Understanding of plant-fungal interaction is constantly coevolving along with the evolution of both the interacting partners. According to the previous scientific literature, many fungi are associated with a single host. Present chapter is focused at elaborating the role of plant cell wall in participating in the interaction. Host cell wall is the outermost barrier which any pathogen has to breach for successful invasion and establishment. Now the question is what is the role of host cell wall in regulating the pathogen s infiltration or restriction? Present study explains the structural dynamism of cell wall which is believed to have functional relevance and is dependent on the behavior of the infecting fungi. Moreover, cell wall is also known to elicit immune signals that brings about transcriptional reprogramming and helps in mounting defense against attacking fungi.

Test specificity requires similar motor unit recruitment, type of contraction, speed of contraction, position of body segments and time characteristics of contraction to be considered. Climbing specific tests may be divided into four areas: 1) Finger flexors strength, involving isometric contraction of the finger flexors on a hold 2-3 cm deep with an open or crimp grip, with the tested arm above the head. 2) Finger flexors endurance, with either a) intermittent test until exhaustion with the 5-12 s contraction and 2-4 s relief at 30-80% MVC, or b) continuous finger hang with both hands on a 2-3 cm deep rung. 3) Shoulder girdle power with either a one or two arm explosive upward movement. 4) Shoulder girdle strength and endurance, bent-arm hang on one or both arms. Supporting normative data is provided for a large range of climbing specific tests, and for a broad spectrum of climbing abilities.",0.0,"Baláš, Jiří",The science of climbing and mountaineering,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Vertebrate viruses in polar ecosystems,"Viruses are non cellular living entities. Their particles are formed by a nucleic acid surrounded by a protein capsid, which together form the so-called nucleocapsid. Nucleocapsids of some virus species are additionally enveloped by a host cell derived lipid envelope containing viral proteins.

Delayed Electroanatomic Mapping After Surgical Ablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation,"Background. Long-term efficacy of catheter-based treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation is unsatisfactory. Minimally invasive surgical ablation techniques have been developed recently but their true efficacy has never been systematically tested. Methods. Seventy patients (median age 63.5 years) with persistent atrial fibrillation underwent epicardial thoracoscopic radiofrequency pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, linear ablation, Marshal ligament disruption, and exclusion of the left atrial appendage. The procedure was followed by electroanatomic mapping 2 to 3 months later. Results. Only 76% of patients were in sinus rhythm at the beginning of electroanatomic mapping. Right PVs were found isolated in a higher proportion of patients compared with left PVs (75.7% versus 91.4%, p &lt, 0.001). All four PVs and the left atrial posterior wall were isolated in 68.6% and 22.9% of patients, respectively. Most of the gaps around left PVs were localized in the superior and anterior quadrants, whereas in right PVs, the gaps were found predominantly on the roof and posterior wall. A typical site of reconduction on the inferior connecting line was the segment adjacent to the right inferior PV. No typical reconduction sites were found on the roof line, as 58.5% of patients required completion of the roof line along its full length. Conclusions. Epicardial PV isolation was successful in the majority of patients, but was underwhelming with regard to isolation of the left PVs. Effective epicardially placed linear lines were rare. Our results highlight the significant limitations associated with a single-stage surgical approach and underline the necessity for a two-staged hybrid approach in the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation.

Experimental Investigation of All-Optical Relay-Assisted 10 Gbps FSO Link over the Atmospheric Turbulence Channel,"This paper presents novel experimental results for a 10 Gbps triple-hop relay-based all-optical free space optical (FSO) system by employing the amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying scheme. We provide a mathematical framework for the end-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the bit-error rate (BER) performance and confirm that the derived analytical results reasonably match experimental results especially at relatively high SNR. The evaluated BER performances under different atmospheric turbulence regimes (modeled by the Gamma-Gamma distribution) show that the considered relay-assisted FSO system offers a significant performance improvement for weak to strong turbulence regimes, even without knowledge of the channel state information. More precisely, at a target BER of 10-5 the proposed scheme offers ~ 5 dB and ~4 dB of SNR gain compared to the direct transmission for turbulence strengths C_n^2 of 3.8x10^(-10) m-2/3 and 5.4 x10^(-12) m-2/3, respectively.",20201.0,"Nor, N.A.M.:Ghassemlooy, Z.:Bohata, Jan:Saxena, P.:Komanec, Matěj:Zvánovec, Stanislav:Bhatnagar, M.R.:Khalighi, M.-A.",IEEE/OSA Journal of Lightwave Technology,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Common Commercial Policy after Opinion 2/15: No simple way to make life easier for free trade agreements in the EU,"On 16 May 2017, the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) delivered a long-awaited opinion on the legal nature of the free trade agreement between the EU and Singapore (Opinion 2/15). This decision was highly anticipated as it was expected to clarify uncertainties of several aspects of the EU Common Commercial Policy (CCP) which has broadened in scope after the Lisbon Treaty. The CJEU&apos,s conclusion on the division of competences and its possible impacts on the CCP immediately sparked a debate within the Union&apos,s institutions about its future direction. In particular, the architecture of EU free trade agreements, the dominant tool of the CCP at the beginning of the 21st century, is now under scrutiny. Trade deals without investment provisions could potentially simplify many steps which now burden the treaty-making process. This paper discusses Opinion 2/15 and its signifi cance for the future development of the CCP. It explores and analyses the implications for shaping the post-Lisbon CCP with regard to two specifi c areas: investment protection and sustainable development. The paper concludes that a new architecture for EU trade agreements could be further improved as there is a potential to preserve the CCP as both an operational and ambitious trade policy. In this respect, comprehensive FTAs encompassing trade, investment and sustainability deserve a second thought in the EU.",50501.0,"Svoboda, Ondřej",Croatian Yearbook of European Law and Policy,4,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dissecting the role of the germinal vesicle nuclear envelope and soluble,"Differentiated nuclei can be reprogrammed/remodelled to totipotency after their  transfer to enucleated metaphase II (MII) oocytes. The process of  eprogramming/remodelling is, however, only partially characterized. It has been shown that the oocyte nucleus (germinal vesicle – GV) components are essential for a successful remodelling of the transferred nukleus by providing the materials for pseudo-nucleus formation. However, the nucleus is a complex structure and exactly what nuclear components are required for a successful nucleus remodelling and reprogramming is unknown. Till date, the only nuclear sub-structure experimentally demonstrated to be essential is the oocyte nucleolus (nucleolus-like body, NLB). In this study, we investigated what other GV components might be necessary for the formation of normal-sized pseudo-pronuclei (PNs). Our results showed that the removal of the GV nuclear envelope with attached chromatin and chromatin-bound factors does not substantially influence the size of the remodelled nuclei in reconstructed cells and that their nuclear envelopes seem to have normal parameters. Rather than the insoluble nuclear lamina, the GV content, which is dissolved in the cytoplasm with the onset of oocyte maturation, influences the characteristics and size of transferred nuclei.",10604.0,"Fulka, Josef",Journal of Reproduction and Development,4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Effect of Calanus Oil Supplementation and 16 Week Exercise Program on Selected Fitness Parameters in Older Women,"We investigated changes in functional fitness after an exercise program in combination with Calanus oil supplementation, a novel source of bioactive lipids rich in wax esters with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA). Fifty-five healthy sedentary women aged 65-80 (mean age 70.9 +/- 3.9 years, BMI 27.24 +/- 3.9 kgm(-2), VO(2)peak 19.46 +/- 3.7 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) were enrolled in the study. The participants were divided into two groups: exercise training plus Calanus Oil supplementation (n = 28) or exercise plus placebo (sunflower oil) supplementation (n = 27). The exercise intervention program was completed by 53 participants and contained functional circuit training (twice a week, 45 min plus 15 min of stretching and balance training) and Nordic walking (once a week, 60 min) for 16 weeks. Senior fitness test, exercise stress test on bicycle ergometer, hand-grip, and body composition were evaluated before and after the program. Our results show that functional fitness and body composition improved following the interventional exercise program, but for most of the parameters there was no synergic effect of supplementing n-3 PUFA-rich Calanus oil. In comparison to the placebo group, the group with Calanus supplementation experienced significantly higher improvement of functional strength of lower body which was evaluated by the chair stand test.

Analysis of selected types of advertisement influencing the driver´s visual attention in real road traffic,"One of the probable causes of road accidents may be a high density of information which may cause the driver to miss a fact significant for dealing with an individual road traffic situation. In particular failure or distraction of the driver's attention often leads to a late recognition of the risk or insufficient information processing. The primary task of advertisement is to attract attention of consumers. Advertisements near the road undoubtedly belong to substantial distractors.  The aim of this article is to present the results of the analysis of the impact of advertisement on the driver's attention in real road traffic. For the analysis of the selected types of advertisement equipment (small advertising equipment, billboards, bigboards and megaboards) the eyetracking methods have been used. Most of currently realized studies have analysed the influence of advertising device under simulated conditions. Therefore, this measurement has been realized in real traffic. Measurement has been carried out with 30 drivers, on 3 different routes in the city.

K 231. Association of Former Political Prisoners in Czechoslovakia during the Prague Spring of 1968,"The Prague Spring of 1968 represents the most extensive attempt at reform Communism. Delayed destalinization brought various changes, and socialism was to be given a &quot,human face.&quot, At the end of March 1968, K-231 was established, associating political prisoners convicted under Section 231 for &quot,subverting the republic&quot,, and over three thousand of them from all over Czechoslovakia gathered in Žofín, Prague. They were called &quot,former people&quot, or &quot,hostile persons&quot, by the ruling Communist regime. Political prisoners stated that they did not want to be a political party. They actively built their organization - they established local, district, regional and provincial branches. They were headquartered on Karlovo náměstí (Charles Square) in Prague, eight commissions were active, and their mission was to achieve legal, civic and social rehabilitation. Around 80,000 members subscribed to the &quot,reform process&quot,, demanded the removal of all discriminatory measures and emphasized that they were not seeking revenge, but justice. Political prisoners from Slovakia became involved in the establishment of K-231, but soon decided to go their own way and set up their own organization. The Slovak Organization for the Defending of Human Rights, a sister organization of K-231, was founded on April 7, 1968 in Bratislava. Although former Czech and Slovak political prisoners acted amicably, they became as undesirable for Dubček?s reform Communists as the Klub angažovaných nestraníků (Club of Involved Independents) or the preparatory committee of the Social Democratic Party. Throughout the Prague Spring, they tried to legalize their activities, but in vain. Instead, they remained under the control of the secret police, and under pressure from Moscow, hostility and media attacks against them escalated. With the occupation of August 21, 1968, when all hopes were shattered, their five-month tenure ended. On September 5, 1968, the Ministry of the Interior refused to register K-231, and the association ceased all operations. Numerous representatives went into exile, those who remained in their homeland became &quot,people of interest&quot, to the State Security, were monitored, called for questioning, and their &quot,counter-revolutionary efforts&quot, were denigrated. In fact, their work showed the possibilities and limits of the Prague Spring. Former political prisoners were still strong enough and their association had great potential, not only moral, but also intellectual and educational. Strong personalities, strong stories - the first organization of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia.",60101.0,"Rokoský, Jaroslav",Pamięć i sprawiedliwość,4,low,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Effect of different resin luting cements on the marginal fit of lithium disilicate pressed crowns,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The vertical marginal discrepancy of restorations can increase upon cementation, and poor marginal fit can lead to cement dissolution, marginal discoloration, microleakage, and secondary caries. The amount of increase is related to the type of luting cement used, but how lithium disilicate pressed crowns are affected by different resin cements is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of using different resin luting cements on the vertical marginal discrepancy of lithium disilicate pressed crowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 18 intact extracted mandibular third molars were disinfected in a solution of 10% formalin for 7 days and were then prepared to receive a ceramic crown. Impressions were made with polyvinyl siloxane and lithium disilicate pressed crowns made and cemented with 1 of 3 resin luting cements. The marginal discrepancy was measured at 4 points on the finishing line of each tooth, with optical microscopy at ×200 magnification before and after cementation. Statistical analysis was done with the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the median marginal increase among the 3 groups (a=.05). RESULTS: The least amount of marginal increase after cementation was with Harvard PremiumFlow cement, with an average marginal increase of 42 ±11 μm. RelyX Ultimate cement increased the margins by an average 45 ±29 μm. The highest marginal increase was found in the Enamel Plus HRi preheated composite resin group (116 ±47 μm). CONCLUSIONS: The marginal increase of pressed crowns cemented with preheated composite resin (Enamel Plus HRi) exceeded the clinically acceptable range of marginal discrepancy.",30208.0,"Mounajjed, Radek:Salinas, Thomas J:Ingr, Tomáš:Azar, Basel",JOURNAL OF PROSTHETIC DENTISTRY,4,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Modeling Flow Phenomena in Pump Station with Overflow,"This paper deals with the numerical analysis of flow in a complete hydraulic system representing the pump station including the influence of the free water level. Particular attention is paid to the discharge object with overflow, which is characterized by the critical flow across the crown of the overflow wall. All basic calculations were accomplished by means of the commercial software ANSYS CFX and ANSYS Fluent with the SST turbulence model. As the flow in the discharge object represents the most interesting part of the results, additional numerical simulations of flow just inside this object were carried out with the DDES scale resolving simulations. Basic calculations inside the complete pump station passage gave surprisingly steady water level in both the intake and discharge objects. They also provided a good picture of the distribution of water velocity close to the water level and corresponding height of water level above the overflow wall crown.

AD, CZECH REPUBLIC)","The aim of the study was to estimate the pre-, peri-, or postnatal origin of localized hypoplasia of primary canine (LHPC) and determine the most common age of death of individuals with LHPC. We also evaluated the total defect formation time and determine the average value in the months ahead. The examined file was 31 non-adults in the necropolis of Great Moravia in ZnojmoHradiště (9th and the first half of the 10th century), who had retained primary canines with LHPC. 80.0% of individuals showed postnatal hypoplastic defect, 13.3% prenatal and 6.7% (n=1) displayed both postnatal and perinatal LHPC, too. The incidence of localised hypoplasia was the same in the upper and lower teeth. In maxillary canines, the incidence of postnatal hypoplasia was very high (90.9%), in the mandibular canines also significantly prevailed but was slightly lower (81.8%). On average, therefore, the incidence of LHPC of postnatal origin was 86.4% for the examined canines. More than half of the examined individuals with LHPC died at the age of 2–5 years. Average time of formation of hypoplastic defects in the primary canines comes in our group at 4.9 months, which is comparable with literature data of 5.2 months.",50404.0,"Jančová, Martina:Drozdová, Eva:Klíma, Bohuslav",Slovenská antropológia.

Impact of technology investment on firm’s production efficiency factor in manufacturing,"The goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of technology investments on produc-tion efficiency in manufacturing companies and how different these relationships are for low-tech-nology and high-technology companies. The empirical part was based on the analysis of 2,848 large, small and medium-sized Czech companies by using Bayesian networks (BNs). The results show that technological investments have the greatest positive impact on the growth of labour productivity and on a decline in labour intensity in low technology enterprises. The technological investments have a positive impact on labour productivity growth in high-technology enterprises, but at the same time, the technological investments have an impact on the increase of labour intensity. On the contrary, the influence of investment growth was insignificant on the indicators of material and services intensity. Technologically intensive investments have a different impact on small, medium-sized and on large enterprises.

The relationship between non-HDL cholesterol and macrophage phenotypes in human adipose tissue,"Data from experimental animal models and in vitro studies suggest that both hyperlipoproteinemia and obesity predispose to development of proinflammatory pathways of macrophages within adipose tissue. The aim of this study was to analyze whether non-HDL cholesterol concentration in healthy living kidney donors (LKDs) is related to the number and phenotype of proinflammatory macrophages in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Adipose tissue samples were collected by cleansing the kidney grafts of LKDs obtained peroperatively. The stromal vascular fractions of these tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry. Proinflammatory macrophages were defined as CD14(+) cells coexpressing CD16(+) and high-expression CD36 as well (CD14(+) CD16(+) CD36(+++)), while CD16 negativity and CD163 positivity identified alternatively stimulated, anti-inflammatory macrophages. Non-HDL cholesterol concentration positively correlated to proinflammatory macrophages within visceral adipose tissue, with increased strength with more precise phenotype determination. On the contrary, the proportion of alternatively stimulated macrophages correlated negatively with non-HDL cholesterol. The present study suggests a relationship of non-HDL cholesterol concentration to the number and phenotype proportion of macrophages in visceral adipose tissue of healthy humans.",0.0,"Poledne, Rudolf:Králová Lesná, Ivana:Králová, Anna:Froněk, Jiří:Čejková, Soňa",Journal of lipid research,4,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Use of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy in the Sport-Scientific Context,"The focus of this research is aimed specifically at the application of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in exercise and sport science. NIRS is able to monitor the performance of muscle and cerebral tissue and evaluate their role during physical activity. By monitoring tissue oxygenation, an NIRS device is useful in several areas which may benefit from its applications. In the sport-scientific context, these tools would allow the follow-up of training performance progression over time, the identification of potential limitations, and an evaluation of the effects of therapeutic and rehabilitative interventions. The purpose of the present paper is to assess the current and potential utilization of the NIRS device in exercise and sport science in order to show the potential of this technique. We would like to introduce some trends evoking current interests and opinions in the field. This review article highlights recent studies related to the in vivo assessment of both cerebral and skeletal muscle tissue in the elite sport context using NIRS technology. After a brief description of the basic principles of NIRS measurement and NIRS technology, the work will examine studies carried out in professional athlete populations in a realistic sporting setting, as well as in some areas of application for laboratory use. Based on our findings, we would like to utilize NIRS to objectivize the rate of load and activation of CNS during exercise in professional athletes in future research projects. Among the findings from the presented studies in this review article, NIRS as a method for the functional evaluation of muscle and cerebral tissue oxidative metabolism has been successfully and reliably used in a variety of sporting contexts.",30306.0,"Simona, Kozlová",Journal of Neurology and Neurological Disorders,4,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Testing the limits of American science-fiction publishing: the case of Jim Grimsley's ""Wendy""","For southern writer Jim Grimsley, child abuse in all its forms has always been an important theme, though he sometimes ran into difficulties selling his work to publishers.

Efficient green emission from edge states in graphene perforated by nitrogen plasma treatment,"Plasma functionalization of graphene is one of the facile ways to tune its doping level without the need for wet chemicals making graphene photoluminescent. Microscopic corrugations in the twodimensional structure of bilayer CVD graphene having a quasi-free-suspended top layer, such as graphene ripples, nanodomes, and bubbles, may significantly enhance local reactivity leading to etching effects on exposure to plasma. Here, we discovered that bilayer CVD graphene treated with nitrogen plasma exhibits efficient UV-green-red emission, where the excitation at 250 nm leads to photoluminescence with the peaks at 390, 470, and 620 nm, respectively.

In vitro and in vivo potential of a blend of essential oil compounds to improve rumen fermentation and performance of dairy cows,"The objective of this study was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo potential of a specific commercial blend of essential oil active compounds (BEO) to improve rumen fermentation and general dairy cow performance. First, the main active components of the BEO were identified and quantified. Then, the in vitro experiment was conducted using 24 h batch incubation of buffered rumen fluid. The BEO was added at 0, 20, 100, 200, 600, and 1000 mg/l of culture fluid, with substrate containing forage and concentrate at a ratio of 60:40 dry matter (DM) basis. The concentrations of 600 and 1000 mg/l decreased (P < 0.05) methane production per dry matter incubated (DMi) by 5.7% and 17.1%, respectively, and a concentration of 1000 mg/l decreased ammonia-N concentration by 10.0%. However, these reductions were accompanied by a decrease (P < 0.05) in apparent dry matter disappearance (aDMd), and lowered (P < 0.05) the net production of volatile fatty acids (nVFA) indicating, that there were no beneficial selective inhibitory properties of BEO supplementation. For the in vivo experiment, 30 lactating Holstein cows (two primiparous and 28 multiparous) in mid-lactation were randomly assigned to two treatments. During a 15 week period, cows in the control group (CON, n=15) were fed the basal diet with no additive, and cows in the other group (BEO, n=15) received the same diet supplemented with 1.2 g/cow/ d BEO. Addition of BEO did not affect (P=0.218) DM intake and milk yield (P=0.102). For feed efficiency (P=0.047) and body weight (P=0.014), the treatment×time interactions were observed, with cows fed BEO having a lower average feed efficiency and a higher average body weight. BEO treatment tended to decrease the proportion of milk fat (P=0.072), without affecting other milk quality parameters. BEO supplemented cows had lower VFA concentrations in rumen fluid (P=0.006), and correspondingly, pH values were higher (P=0.018). No differences were detected between the treatments for proportions of individual VFA and ammonia-N concentration. The responses of dairy cows on BEO were more  pronounced after the 5th week of supplementation. This indicates the necessity of a longer adaptation period than commonly used in studies evaluating the effects of essential oils (EO). Due to energetic shift toward body weight gain additional attention should be paid to the systemic effects of EO. Generally, results from this study suggest that mid-lactation dairy cows did not benefit from being supplemented with BEO.",40201.0,"Joch, Miroslav:Kudrna, Václav:Homolka, Petr:Illek, Josef:Tyrolová, Yvona:Výborná, Alena",Animal Feed Science and Technology,4,low,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Brain Electrical Activity Mapping in Military Pilots During Simulator Trainings,"The aim of this study is to describe an evaluation method and measurement methodology for the study of variations in electroencephalography (EEG) signals in fighter pilots during training. The study is needed to monitor the mental state of fighter pilots during training. Knowledge of a pilot's mental state during training could help to determine their readiness to perform a combat mission. It is generally known that changes in mental state and stress is manifested in electrical activity of the brain. To assess variations in the brain’s electrical activity, it is assumed to use the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. EEG signals were obtained from two fighter pilots. The data was recorded during training missions on a flight simulator. The simulated training mission was composed of three submissions (composed of stressful events and mid events). The non-linear Poincaré plot analysis was used for evaluation of EEG variability during training. The results were presented using the brain electrical activity mapping. The results showed statistically significant differences in EEG variability, when comparing a stressful event with mid event periods. This finding demonstrated the ability of the proposed method to quantify mental load, i.e. the stress of fighter pilots during flight simulator training.

Printable Solar Cells,"Printable photovoltaic modules, along with other printed electronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes, thin film transistors, capacitors, coils, resistors, etc., are a low-cost alternative to the conventionally deposited devices. Due to its fabrication simplicity and the feasibility of using large-area flexible substrates, printable solar cell (PSC) is a prospective candidate in many application fields. Furthermore, light-absorbing layer of PSC is usually several orders of magnitude thinner than widely used conventional Si solar cells, thus production of PCS requires much less material, and in the case of printing deposition there is very little waste of material in comparison to other deposition methods. The possibility of using flexible large scale substrates opens the door to multiple advanced application opportunities such as smart textiles, photovoltaic window shades, etc. This chapter addresses a topic regarding key aspects of development, fabrication, and application with respect to PSC, mostly CIGS, perovskite and organic solar cells. First off, working principles, applicability of PSC, their merits and demerits, and future application possibilities are considered.

Pens with Temporary Crating: A Viable Alternative Housing System to Improve the Welfare of Lactating Sows - Review,"Farrowing pens with temporary confinement over the first few days post-partum have been developed as a compromise between conventional farrowing crates and pens to better satisfy the needs of the sow and of the piglets during lactation. From the sow standpoint, temporary confinement may increase sow welfare by allowing pre and post-partum natural maternal behaviour and improve (physical) comfort, which are drastically compromised in crates. From the piglet standpoint, temporary confinement of the sow during the first days after farrowing may be a way to ensure piglet survival, which may be more at risk in loose housing conditions due to crushing. This paper reviews the current knowledge on pens with temporary crating for lactating sows and shows that, even though more research is needed, this system appears to be a beneficial alternative to farrowing crates and may constitute an intermediate step preceding implementation of permanent loose-housing environment",40201.0,"Wackermannová, Marie:Goumon, Sébastien:Illmannová, Gudrun",Research in Pig Breeding,4,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Analyzing the mechanisms of iron oxide nanoparticles interactions with cells: a road from failure to success in clinical applications,"Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were the first generation of nanomaterials that reached real clinic use. Particularly, several IONPs-based magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents gained approval by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, latter body of evidence revealed the overlooked side effects of IONPs, resulting in their withdrawal. Emerging evidence suggests that this happened due to poor understanding of the mechanisms by which IONPs act at the cellular and sub-cellular levels.

Geography of Tourism in the Czech Republic,"The chapter deals with a spatial aspects of tourism development in the Czech Republic. Based on Mariot`s (1973) a three-dimensional model of tourism organization we evaluate three kinds of preconditions for tourism development: localization, realisation and selective factors. In these context the chapter provides an analysis of the natural and cultural-historical preconditions for tourism, analysis of the accommodation facilities and sport-recreational and transport infrastructure as well as spatial variations of tourism demand. Explanation of the spatial patterns identify functional roles and linkages between mentioned factors of development. Particular attention is paid to main forms and types of tourism in the Czech Republic such as: urban tourism, rural tourism, trade fair and congress tourism, spa and wellness tourism, winter recreation and tourism, summer water recreation, wine tourism and seconds homes.

Impact testing of polymer-filled auxetics using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar,"In this paper, impact testing of auxetic structures filled with strain rate sensitive material is presented. Two dimensional missing rib, 2D re-entrant honeycomb, and 3D re-entrant honeycomb lattices are investigated. Structures are divided into three groups according to type of filling: no filling, low expansion polyurethane foam, and ordnance gelatine. Samples from each group are tested under quasi-static loading and dynamic compression using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar. Digital image correlation is used for assessment of in-plane displacement and strain fields. Ratios between quasi-static and dynamic results for plateau stresses and specific energy absorption in the plateau are calculated. It is found out that not only the manufactured structures, but also the wrought material exhibit strain rate dependent properties. Evaluation of influence of filling on mechanical properties shows that polyurethane increases specific absorbed energy by a factor of 1.05–1.4, whereas the effect of gelatine leads to increase of only 5–10%. Analysis of the Poisson's function reveals influence of filling on achievable (negative) values of Poisson's ratio, when compared to unfilled specimens. The results for the Poisson's function yielded apparently different values as the assessed minima of quasi-static Poisson's ratio in small deformations are constrained by a factor of 15.",20505.0,"Fíla, Tomáš:Zlámal, Petr:Jiroušek, Ondřej:Falta, Jan:Koudelka, Petr:Kytýř, Daniel:Doktor, Tomáš:Valach, Jaroslav",Advanced Engineering Materials,4,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do We Need Minimal Solutions of Fuzzy Relational Equations in Advance?,"Minimal solutions play a crucial role in description of all solutions to a fuzzy relational equation. The reason is that all solutions form a convex set with respect to (fuzzy) set inclusion, therefore, having all extremal solutions, we can represent the entire solution set as a union of intervals bounded from above by the greatest solution and from below by the minimal solutions. However, when computing the intervals, we obtain many duplicate solutions. The obvious question is as follows: Is there another way of representing the solution set, for instance, without the need of having all the minimal solutions in advance?

Bioconversion of carbon dioxide to methane using hydrogen and hydrogenotrophic methanogens,"Biogas produced from organic wastes contains energetically usable methane and unavoidable amount of carbon dioxide. The biological conversion of this CO2 to methane is well known reaction without the demand of high pressure and temperature and is carried out by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Reducing equivalents to the biotransformation of carbon dioxide from biogas or other resources to biomethane can be supplied by external hydrogen. Discontinuous electricity production from wind and solar energy combined with fluctuating utilization cause serious storage problems that can be solved by power-to-gas strategy representing the production of storable hydrogen via the electrolysis of water. Biomethanization of CO2 can take place directly in anaerobic digesters fed with organic substrates, in separate bioreactors or in hybride reactor which combines both methods. There are many studies with different bioreactors arrangements and a way of enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, but the system still has to be optimized for a higher efficiency. The aim of the paper is to gather and critically assess the state of a research and experience from laboratory, pilot and operational applications of carbon dioxide bioconversion and highlight further perspective fields of research.",20801.0,"Zábranská, Jana:Pokorná, Dana",Biotechnology Advances,4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Experimental Demonstration of High-Speed 4 x 4 Imaging Multi-CAP MIMO Visible Light Communications,"In general, visible light communication (VLC) systems, which utilise white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), only offer a bandwidth limited to the lower MHz region. Therefore, providing VLC-based high data rate communications systems using VLC becomes a challenging task. To address this challenge, we propose a solution based on multiplexing in both the frequency and space domains. We experimentally demonstrate a 4 x 4 imaging multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) VLC system (i.e., space multiplexing) utilising multiband carrierless amplitude and phase (m-CAP)modulation (i.e., frequency multiplexing). Independently, both MIMO and m-CAP have separately shown the remarkable ability to improve the transmission speeds in VLC systems, and hence, here we combine them to further improve the net data rate. We investigate the link performance by varying the number of subcarriers m, link distance L, and signal bandwidth Bsig. From all the values tested, we show that a data rate of ~249 Mb/s can be maximally achieved for m= 20,Bsig = 20 MHz, and L = 1m, at a bit error rate of 3.2 x 10-3 using LEDswith~4MHz bandwidth.",20202.0,"Werfli, K.:Chvojka, Petr:Ghassemlooy, Z.:Hassan, N.B.:Zvánovec, Stanislav:Burton, A.:Haigh, P.A.:Bhatnagar, M.R.",IEEE/OSA Journal of Lightwave Technology,4,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Private Tutoring in English Through the Eyes of Its Recipients,"The individualistic nature of learning nowadays, coupled with the global spread of English, has contributed to the rise of shadow education in English. This study focuses on one of its forms, one-on-one private tutoring in English (PTE), more specifically, it explores this privately purchased service through the eyes of its recipients, learners of English. The aim of this study is to uncover the nature of the PTE that the learners experienced and the perceived role of this type of education in their lives. The study investigates the learners’ lives from early childhood to their entry to university, deploying a narrative interview as a data-gathering instrument. Twenty respondents were interviewed, then the qualitative analysis of the interviews was conducted using open coding. The findings of the study suggest that PTE supplements formal education in the course of the students’ lives. Its role in learners’ lives is linked to remedial or enrichment purposes. Children’s involvement in PTE is initiated either by their parents or by the children themselves for a variety of purposes reflecting all kinds of their needs. Concerning those who provide PTE, they constitute a diverse group including both native and non-native speakers of English, however, nothing is known about them and about the quality of their service.

Probing protein adsorption onto polymer-stabilized silver nanocolloids towards a better understanding on the evolution and consequences of biomolecular coronas,"The use of noble metal nanoparticles in biomedical and biotechnological applications is nowadays well established. Particularly, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were proven to be effective for instance as a biocide agent. They also find applications in tumor therapies and sensing applications being encouraging tools for in-vivo imaging. In this framework, whenever they are in contact with living systems, they are rapidly coated by a protein corona thereby influencing a variety of biological events including cellular uptake, blood circulation lifetime, cytotoxicity and, ultimately, the therapeutic effect. Taking these considerations into account, we have explored the behavior of polymer-coated AgNPs in model protein environments focusing on the self-development of protein coronas. The polymers polyethyleneimine (PEI), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and poly(2-vinyl pyridine)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-P2VP) were used as stabilizing agents. The chemical nature of the polymer capping remarkably influences the behavior of the hybrid nanomaterials in protein environments. The PEO-b-P2VP and PVP-stabilized AgNPs are essentially inert to the model proteins adsorption. On the other hand, the PEI-stabilized AgNPs interact strongly with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Nevertheless, the same silver colloids were evidenced to be stable in IgG and lysozyme environments. The BSA adsorption into the PEI-stabilized AgNPs is most probably driven by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions as suggested by isothermal titration calorimetry data. The development of protein coronas around the AgNPs may have relevant implications in a variety of biological events. Therefore, further investigations are currently underway to evaluate the influence of its presence on the cytotoxicity, hemolytic effects and biocide properties of the produced hybrid nanomaterials.",10404.0,"Batista, C.

In general, identification of pure cultures of bacteria using conventional phenotyping techniques requires 4-24 hours. Recently available new molecular technologies offer the potential of same day species identification once pure culture is available. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of rDNA V1 hypervariable region pyrosequencing, and the whole cell MALDI-TOF MS protein profiling in routine species identification. During the period from June 2012 to June 2014, 1.140 pure culture isolates were recovered from 402 samples from 126 patients suffering cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis. All the isolates were subjected to species identification by both techniques. Unfortunately, pyrosequencing was able to reach the species level in 43.2% of isolates only, whereas MALDI-TOF was clearly superior with 96.8% respectively.",0.0,"Navrátilová, Lucie:Procházková, Petra:Bardoň, Jan:Novotný, Radko:Raclavský, Vladislav",Journal of Biological Methods,4,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Vimentin Intermediate Filaments as Potential Target for Cancer Treatment,"Intermediate filaments constitute the third component of the cellular skeleton. Unlike actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, the intermediate filaments are composed of a wide variety of structurally related proteins showing distinct expression patterns in tissues and cell types. Changes in the expression patterns of intermediate filaments are often associated with cancer progression, in particular with phenotypes leading to increased cellular migration and invasion.

Pop-rurality: Rurality Interdiscourse in the Village of the Year Competition,"The Village of the Year in the Czech Republic is a national competition held since 1995, announced annually by the Ministry of Regional Development. Its aim is to promote the &quot,restoration&quot, and &quot,development&quot, of the Czech countryside through communal projects carried out by villagers themselves. Each year hundreds of Czech and Moravian villages enter the competition. Being focused on the countryside, the notion of rurality is one of the competition&apos,s defining features. But what kind of rurality is it? What are its constituents? How it is performed in the village competition projects? And what are the sources of the forms it takes? Our analysis of media representations by village competitors (web sites, video presentations, etc.), alongside materials provided for competitors by the Ministry and other participating organizations (competition rules, official documents, etc.) and various media representations of the competition (television reports, etc.), reveals how the discourses involved operate and how they create a certain &quot,ideal&quot, village that is to be seen as a model to be followed. We argue that the several discourses of rurality interwoven in the representations of villages within the competition (those of experts/academics, public/media, villagers, and policymakers) form an interdiscourse of &quot,poprurality&quot,, which is a rurality deterritorialized, enriched with shared global (pop-cultural) elements, and re-territorialized again, to then float freely in public (especially virtual) space.",50404.0,"Novotná, Hedvika:Bittnerová, Dana:Heřmanský, Martin",Lidé města / Urban People,4,high,high,1,1,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

XRD analysis showed that the maximum dislocation density was achieved after six DRECE passes, which were accompanied by the formation that is typical for low-strain structures. The increasing dislocation density, as well as grain refinement throughout DRECE deformation, resulted in an increase in the mechanical properties.

Classification of Hydrometeors Using Measurements of the Ka-Band Cloud Radar Installed at the Milešovka Mountain (Central Europe),"In radar meteorology, greater interest is dedicated to weather radars and precipitation analyses. However, cloud radars provide us with detailed information on cloud particles from which the precipitation consists of. Motivated by research on the cloud particles, a vertical Ka-band cloud radar (35 GHz) was installed at the Milešovka observatory in Central Europe and was operationally measuring since June 2018. This study presents algorithms that we use to retrieve vertical air velocity (Vair) and hydrometeors. The algorithm calculating Vair is based on small-particle tracers, which considers the terminal velocity of small particles negligible and, thereby, Vair corresponds to the velocity of the small particles. The algorithm classifying hydrometeors consists of calculating the terminal velocity of hydrometeors and the vertical temperature profile. It identifies six hydrometeor types (cloud droplets, ice, and four precipitating particles: rain, graupel, snow, and hail) based on the calculated terminal velocity of hydrometeors, temperature, Vair, and Linear Depolarization Ratio.

Intracerebral EEG Artifact Identification Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Manual and semi-automatic identification of artifacts and unwanted physiological signals in large intracerebral electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings is time consuming and inaccurate. To date, unsupervised methods to accurately detect iEEG artifacts are not available. This study introduces a novel machine-learning approach for detection of artifacts in iEEG signals in clinically controlled conditions using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and benchmarks the method's performance against expert annotations. The method was trained and tested on data obtained from St Anne's University Hospital (Brno, Czech Republic) and validated on data from Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, U.S.A). We show that the proposed technique can be used as a generalized model for iEEG artifact detection. Moreover, a transfer learning process might be used for retraining of the generalized version to form a data-specific model. The generalized model can be efficiently retrained for use with different EEG acquisition systems and noise environments. The generalized and specialized model F1 scores on the testing dataset were 0.81 and 0.96, respectively.

"Influence of Apple Mosaic Virus on the Growth, Yield, and Qualities of Saaz Hop","The aim of this study is to elucidate the influence of apple mosaic virus (ApMV) infection on Saaz hop in the Saaz region of Czech Republic. The comparison between virus free and ApMV infection for the growth, yield and qualoties of Saaz hop was studied in one test garden in detail over two consecutive years (2010 and 2011). ApMV weakened vegetative growth and decreased hop cone yield. ApMV infection resulted in a decrease in the production of humulone (alpha acid) and essential oil. The composition of terpene compounds, which contribute to the hoppy aroma of beer, were also affected. ApMV-infected hop cones had lower ratio of mono-terpenes, and higher ratio of sesqui-terpenes than those derived from uninfected plants. Beer brewed using ApMV-infected hops had a diminished fruity aroma compared to beer brewed using uninfected hops. From these results, protecting hop plants from ApMV infection is important for maintaining both quantity and quality of hop. In some commercial gardens, it was confirmed that hop plants have been maintained virus-free for over 20 years. This fact suggests that good field practices can protect hop plants from virus infections.",40101.0,"Krofta, Karel:Šnidlová, Jana:Matsui, Hiroo:Kroupa, František:Inui, Takako:Oka, Kaneo:Fukui, Nobuyuki",Journal of Plant Sciences,4,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Personalistic Approach as a Bridge,"The author of the present contribution deals with the development of the personalistic inspiration in comparative literary studies as a bridge connecting the traditional auctorial approaches and those of textual and receptionist perspectives. He found the inspiration in the psychological methods created by A. Potebnya and his predecessors and successors in Russian 19th-century literary criticism as well as in psychopoetics. The writer is a real creator of a literary artefact - a crucial node and crossroads of all the factors in literary creation and reception. The restoration and revitalization of a new concept of the author has to be understood as the end of the hyperbolized, exaggerated and overestimated reader. As the reader becomes the author, and the author is allowed to enter his work and work only as a reader, the author may function as a complex reader who transforms their experience into an active literary creation by converting and transforming their own psychic and existential situation into a literary artefact. The author in all these aspects cannot be ignored or suppressed neither by the text itself nor by wider concepts that integrate literature into culture and thus free literature from its specific characteristics. To search for the balance of both poles of literary creation and communication was the real intention of these remarks.",60205.0,"Pospíšil, Ivo",Slavica litteraria,4,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Writing for Multiculturalism: Argument-based Satire of Ishmael Reed against the New Racism.,"The chapter demonstrates how the satire of Ishmael Reed has evolved from a stage which frequently criticises through non-standard sexuality to a stage which frequently criticises through logical argumentation (as can be seen in novels published in 1990s and 2010s). By discussing examples from Reed's 1993 novel Japanese by Spring, the chapter connects these two modes of satire to two types of American racism: overt (present in the public discourse till the Civil Rights Movement) and covert (present in the public discourse after the Civil Rights Movement). It concludes by illustrating that as overt racism became unacceptable in American public discourse, Ishmael Reed updated his satire so that it would be argument-driven and could remain an effective type of social critique even under the new circumstances.",0.0,"Šalamoun, Jiří",American Multiculturalism in Context Views from at Home and Abroad,4,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Timing of Initial Public Offerings - Non-Numerical Model Based on Qualitative Trends,"The objective of this study is to develop a qualitative model supporting chief financial officers (CFOs) while considering the timing of initial public offerings (IPOs) under conditions of underdeveloped capital markets, where decision making is often made under information shortage. A lack of adequate statistical data in connection with turbulently changing environment suggests that additional research is needed to develop new IPO timing models based not only on statistical analyses. We used a qualitative research approach based on trends, which are increasing, constant or decreasing. Firstly, we identified key variables influencing IPO timing, which have sufficient support in the relevant IPO academic literature, e.g. GDP growth rates, level of compliance, stock market returns, etc. Next, a qualitative model working with 9 variables was developed. The result is represented by 19 scenarios and their qualitative solutions. The transitional graph represents all possible transitions among the 19 scenarios. The main message of the findings presented is what scenarios can occur and what actions might be implemented by CFOs in order to increase the chances of IPO success.

On the Numerical Determination of Stability Regions in the Delay Space via Dominant Pole Estimation,"This contribution intends to provide the reader with the presentation of a numerical gridding iterative algorithm to determine all stability regions within the prescribed area of the delay space. In every single grid node, the iterative estimation of the rightmost pole is computed based on the polynomial approximation of the characteristic quasipolynomial, by utilizing the knowledge of the dominant pole estimation in the nearest grid node. The polynomial approximation is made via the Taylor series based expansion in the vicinity of the closest dominant poles estimation, and by using the bilinear transformation followed with pre-warping for a discrete-time approximation. Exponential terms are subjected to a quadratic extrapolation method to get commensurate delays. Two-step Newton’s iteration method with averaging is used to detect imaginary axis crossings. Neutral delay case is concisely discussed as well. Two numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm.

Assessment of changes in somatic characteristics based on the level of physical activity in women who undertaken weight reduction course,"Objective: Obesity is a chronic disease in modern age and finding approach to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of obesity has its place among the priorities of modern medicine and related fields. Important component in programs to reduce overweight and obesity is regular physical activity (PA), which plays vital role in the comprehensive approach to the treatment of obesity. Primary objective of our study was to assess changes in somatic characteristics following eleven weeks of PA in overweight and obese women aged 30 to 60 years. Methods: Our research sample consisted of 221 women who were classified according to the level of PA carried out, namely 1st, 2nd and 3rd category. STOB course participants underwent PA monitoring and diagnosis of the body composition, which is a modern multifaceted cognitive behavioural method. Results: Younger highly active women (PA_3) achieved higher average differences in body fat than did women with the typical daily activity (PA_1), however significant differences had not been found. Statistically significant differences in visceral fat between the 1st (PA_1) and 3rd PA category (PA_3) had been observed in older women. Conclusion: Given the significantly higher increase of fat-free mass percentage in older highly active women (PA_3), we may assess the course results positively. Our study demonstrated positive correlation between carrying out the recommended level of PA and its impact on the body composition’s health risk indicators.

Proteomic Methods of Detection and Quantification of Protein Toxins.,"Biological toxins are a heterogeneous group of compounds that share commonalities with biological and chemical agents. Among them, protein toxins represent a considerable, diverse set. They cover a broad range of molecular weights from less than 1000 Da to more than 150 kDa. This review aims to compare conventional detection methods of protein toxins such as in vitro bioassays with proteomic methods, including immunoassays and mass spectrometry-based techniques and their combination. Special emphasis is given to toxins falling into a group of selected agents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as Staphylococcal enterotoxins, Bacillus anthracis toxins, Clostridium botulinum toxins, Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin, ricin from Ricinus communis, Abrin from Abrus precatorius or control of trade in dual-use items in the European Union, including lesser known protein toxins such as Viscumin from Viscum album.

Synergistic effects of glyphosate formulation herbicide and tank-mixing adjuvants on Pardosa spiders,"Glyphosate-based herbicides are the world&apos,s most consumed agrochemicals, and they are commonly used in various agroecosystems, including forests, as well as in urban zones and gardens. These herbicides are sold as formulations containing adjuvants. Other tank-mixing adjuvants (most often surfactants) are commonly added to these formulations prior to application. According to the manufacturers of agrochemicals, such tank mixes (as these are known in agronomic and horticultural practice) have modified properties and perform better than do the herbicides as used alone. The effects of these tank mixes on the environment and on beneficial arthropods are almost unknown. Therefore, we studied whether a herbicide formulation mixed with adjuvant has modified effects on one of the most common genera of ground-dwelling wolf spiders vis-a-vis the herbicide formulation and adjuvants themselves. Specifically, we studied the synergistic effect in the laboratory on the predatory activity (represented by the number of killed flies) of wolf spiders in the genus Pardosa after direct treatment using the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup klasik Pro (R) , Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Wetcit (R) , Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Agrovital (R) , and the surfactants alone. We found that pure surfactants as well as herbicide-and-surfactants tank mixes significantly decrease the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as Roundup klasik Pro (R) did not itself have any such effect. Our results support the hypothesis that plant protection tank mixes may have modified effect on beneficial arthropods as compared to herbicide formulations alone. Therefore, testing of pesticide tank mixes is highly important, because it is these tank mixes that are actually applied to the environment.

The iconic Hector Pieterson photo and the power of adaptations,"In South Africa, the iconic Hector Pieterson photo is the starting point for many artists to deal with their own personal trauma and the communal trauma of their nation. The iconicity of this photo has sparked many different adaptations in various fields of art. Considering that we are talking about a traumatized country, Freud&apos,s concept of “repetition compulsion” seems to be one explanation for this phenomenon. However, art is only seldom a mere product of traumatization. Quayson&apos,s concept of “symbolization compulsions” comes closer to explaining the phenomenon of repetition in the arts, because it leaves the artists more freedom of expression and does not suggest that art is the result of illness, while still implying &apos,compulsion&apos, and &apos,obsession&apos, in the act of creation. I want to suggest that &apos,repetition&apos, in the arts in the South African context is not so much a sign of confinement and restriction, but that the many adaptations of the unique historical incident should rather be understood as attempts of &apos,working through&apos, collective trauma, making sense of history, and contributing to the country&apos,s healing.",60206.0,"Mengel, Ewald",Tydskrif vir Letterkunde,4,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An assessment of thermo-mechanically induced fatigue damage of a steam turbine shaft,"The increasing demands on the flexibility of steam turbines due to the use of renewable energy sources substantially alters the fatigue strength requirements of components of these facilities. The work summarized hereafter was initiated by the effort to develop the methodology of prediction of thermo-mechanical fatigue of steam turbine rotors. A significant effort was put into local thermo-mechanical stress-strain response modelling in the shaft material. An FE model of the structure assuming 2D axisymmetry idealisation was developed and verified. In-house codes based on a variety of approaches to assess critical location and fatigue damage, including the Manson-McKnight and the Nagode methods, were created. The experimental programme aimed to investigate the material fatigue behaviour under the thermo-mechanical conditions was initiated in order to provide data for calibrating and verifying the fatigue prediction procedures.

Exogenous salicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide attenuate drought stress in rice,"Hydrogen peroxide and salicylic acid exhibit protective effects against a wide array of stresses. In this study, we investigated the relative efficacy of exogenous H2O2 and SA in conferring drought tolerance in rice. The experiment was repeated two times, firstly in a hydroponic system and secondly in soil. The results revealed that drought hampered germination indices, seedling growth, photosynthetic pigments, and water content, whereas increased proline content. It also triggered higher H2O2 production and consequently elevated lipid peroxidation, which is a particular indication of oxidative damage. However, exogenous H2O2 or SA treatment effectively alleviated oxidative damage in rice seedlings both in hydroponic and soil systems via upregulating antioxidant enzymes. Nevertheless, regulation of proline level and augmentation of plant-water status were crucial to confer drought tolerance.

The effect of ultrahigh volume ultrafine blast furnace slag on the properties of cement pastes,"The dosage of blast furnace slag (BFS) in cement is limited on account of relative low reaction rate and low early strength. Improving the early age activity of BFS is the fundamental solution for high volume BFS cementitious materials. Generally, mechanical activation is one of the main techniques to accelerate the early reaction of mineral admixtures. In this study, wet-milling and dry-separation are respectively used to prepare ultrafine BFS to improve its early reactivity. The early hydration characteristics, mechanical property, hydration products of ultrahigh volume BFS cementitious materials are analyzed to assess the efficiency of ultrafine BFS on the properties of BFS cement paste. The results show that the initial and final setting time both gradually decrease as the dry-separation BFS (GS) dosage increases, while the wet milling BFS (WS) series present the opposite tendency. The electrical resistivity of WS specimens develops at a faster rate than that of GS specimens. Mixes containing WS, at a maximum dosage of 90%, have higher mechanical property than those with GS, resulting in an enhancement of strength. The hydration products mainly include calcium hydroxide, hydrotalcite, hydrotalcite-like phase, calcium carbonate, stratlingite, C-S-H, C-A-S-H, and akermanite. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We only focus on the therapies consisting in the provision of unregistered medicinal products. The law is often restrictive in allowing patients to be provided with experimental therapies even if they grant fully informed consent. The Czech law and a recent Czech case of an unapproved stem cell therapy provide a basis for the analysis of the problem with universally applicable conclusions. We argue that the regulation of access to unapproved therapies serves an important public interest of the protection of public trust in the health system and hence is justified.

Outsourcing modelling using a novel interval-valued fuzzy quantitative strategic planning matrix (QSPM) and multiple criteria decision-making (MCDMs),"Outsourcing drives companies to focus on: their capabilities, advantages of external resources, and decreasing overall operational costs. Selecting appropriate alliances, which are aligned with the company&apos,s strategies, establishes a situation through which the firms can enhance their technical capabilities and achieve new technologies. However, two critical issues in outsourcing modeling should be addressed: how to find strategic indicators for building successful alliances, and how to select these partners. Besides, as the imprecise and vague information (due to a lack of data) existing in the outsourcing models cannot be neglected, the application of fuzzy interval sets could efficiently address the complexity of these problems. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a two-step interval-based framework for the problem. At the beginning, and for the first time, the novel integration of an interval valued fuzzy (IVF) version of strength-weakness-opportunity-threats (SWOT) technique and the quantitative strategic planning matrix (QSPM) with Gap analysis is designed to find the most effective strategies for the alliance evaluation, and to weight them. In the next step, four interval-valued version of multiple criteria decision-making methods (IVF-MCDMs) are implemented to evaluate the strategic partners. Finally, the results are aggregated with the help of the utility interval approach, and a sensitivity analysis is implemented to assess the robustness of the proposed methodology. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, a real partner selection problem at a holding car manufacturing factory in Iran is presented.

Political Will and Public Opinion : On Hegel's Theory of Representation,"Thee article accepts Ritter&apos,s dictum that Hegel is a philosopher of the French Revolution. Admittedly, Hegel considers the French Revolution to be the political birth of the modern era, nevertheless he also sees this historical event as the warning example of democracy based on the general will of the people which results in a terror. The article seeks to explain the argument that Hegel&apos,s mature theory of representation makes both against Rousseau&apos,s conception of the general will and against the modern tradition of liberal contractualism. Of key importance in this respect are the concepts &quot,political will&quot, and &quot,public opinion&quot,, which play, as Urbinati has argued, a key role in the theory of representation. The starting point of the argument is Schmitt&apos,s distinction between representation and identity as two principles of political form, which is to some extent shared also by Hegel in his polemic with Rousseau as a theorist of democratic revolution. Hegel understands the State as the unifi cation of civil society in political will, which is mediated by a number of institutions. This mediation of will is seen as a process of political representation, in which the fundamental role is played by the estates (Stände). Hegel&apos,s theory of representation also sets it against the tradition of liberal contractualism, as shown in a polemic with Kant&apos,s conception of the public. But Hegel&apos,s conception of public opinion betrays his considerable mistrust of the subversive potential of democracy. Nevertheless, his theory of representation offers us a fundamental way to think about the concepts of political will and public opinion, thus creating an alternative tradition of modern political theory and providing us with a theoretical instrument for contemplating the contemporary crisis of representative democracy.",50601.0,"Znoj, Milan",Filosofický časopis,4,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Life Cycle Assessment Method - Tool for Evaluation of Greenhouse Gases Emissions from Agriculture and Food Processing,"The chapter focuses on the use of the Life Cycle Assessment method to monitor the emission load of foods from different systems of farming production. The products of the conventional and organic farming production intended for public catering are compared within the SUKI and UMBESA international projects. Besides the comparison of agricultural production, processed and unprocessed foods, local and imported foods and fresh and stored foods were compared as well. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which is used to assess environmental impacts of products and services throughout their entire life cycle, was used to quantify the emission load. About 20 most frequently used foods for school catering facilities were compared. The results of the project confirm the general assumption about the less emission load of unprocessed, fresh and local products. It may not clearly state that products from organic farming produce less emissions when comparing agricultural systems. It always depends on the particular crop. The absence of synthetic substances such as fertilizers and pesticides reduces the emission load of organic farming, on the other hand, a higher number of mechanical operations and especially the lower income clearly increase the emission burden, therefore, in several cases, lower emission loads of crops were achieved using the conventional farming system. The situation is different regarding the following phases of food production, processing and transport. The transport phase significantly worsens the environmental profile of organic foods, because transport distances are too far due to insufficient processing capacity and underdeveloped market networks, and often exceed the emission savings from the agricultural phase. On the contrary, conventional foods are carried within relatively short distances, therefore the final emission load of conventional foods is in many cases fewer than the load of organic foods.",0.0,"Jelínková, Zuzana:Moudrý, Jan:Moudrý, Jan:Bernas, Jaroslav:Kopecký, Marek",Greenhouse Gases,4,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Experimental and numerical analysis of semi-destructive device for in situ assessment of wood properties in compression parallel to grain,"A reconstruction of historical timber structures requires precise diagnostics of mechanical properties of particular structural members, which would subsequently underlie a reliable plan of the reconstruction. Mechanical properties of wood are determined most exactly using destructive techniques, but often they cannot be used in historical constructions. This calls for using nondestructive or semi-destructive techniques that are still reasonably exact, not too invasive and can be profitably used in situ. This work examines a new nondestructive diagnostic tool that enables to determine strength and stiffness parameters of wood parallel to the grain in situ. The function of the instrument was verified using standard compression tests parallel to the grain that correlated with the instrument well (r = 0.92). Complicated stress state in the drilled hole was examined by contact finite element analysis and revealed high contribution of longitudinal elastic moduli in force measurement (r = 0.96).",20502.0,"Kloiber, Michal:Kunecký, Jiří:Drdácký, Miloš:Tippner, J.:Sebera, V.",Wood Science and Technology,4,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Occupational Safety of Municipal Police Officers: Assessing the Vulnerability and Riskiness of Police Officers’ Work,"The municipal police agencies increase the safety of a municipality’s citizens and thus increase their quality of life. When performing interventions, municipal police officers may endanger their safety and health. This paper deals with the analysis of the riskiness of municipal police officers working in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic from 2004 to 2019 and the assessment of their occupational safety. The risk analysis was carried out on the basis of a risk matrix and calculations of the probability of attack and injury to municipal police officers. Using the Pearson correlation coefficient, the dependence between the selected variables was investigated. The reliability of this dependence was examined by the determination coefficient. The main result of the paper is the determination of the riskiness category of municipal police officer work based on the assessment of the occupational health protection of officers through statistical indicators of their activities and risk matrix.

A New Intercultural Curriculum for Literature and Culture in English-Language Teacher Preparation,"What is the connection between the theoretical discussions presented in this volume and an English-language teacher preparation program? How can these broader theoretical issues be applied in a European higher education institution? This chapter describes the genesis of a part of a second-language teacher education (SLTE) program that uses principles of intercultural communication to restructure the pedagogy of literature and culture. It tells how a curriculum previously organized into historical surveys was transformed into a one that embraces English as an international language, employing more flexible organizational principles in order to respond to the future needs of English-language teachers. The authors of this chapter identified the skills involved in crosscultural communication and asked how these could be developed across the broader range of global anglophone culture. This kind of analysis drew on the team’s training in both ELT methodology and literary criticism, which was then applied to texts that eschewed nationalist narratives and exemplified intercultural exchange. The chapter outlines how syllabi and assessments were transformed, and also how the literature curriculum moved from a knowledge-based approach to the teaching of intercultural awareness, while retaining literature as a central component.",50302.0,"Klečková, Gabriela:Quinn, Justin John:Vice, William Bradley",Anglophone Literature in Second-Language Teacher Education Curriculum Innovation through Intercultural Communication,4,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"A Work of Art at the Centre of Public Interest - Stories, Characters, Forms and Values in the Process of Social Representation","As early as 2004, in his essay &quot,Haven&apos,t We Had Enough?&quot, the Slovenian art theoretician Igor Zabel called for the rethinking and cultural reinterpretation of the trauma associated with Central Europe&apos,s totalitarian past. This rethinking could not only return this territory into the all-European space once and for all, but might also significantly contribute to its search for a new identity in the face of the dramatic social and political challenges in the current globalised world. lt is obvious that the situation in Central Europe has long been heading towards a deep crisis, which threatens a return to undemocratic social trends and political practices infamously familiar from the period of totalitarianism. To follow the socio-cultural discourse found in current artistic pro-duction, we can focus on strategies that apply the princi ples of appropriation to significant visual indicators of totalitarian systems. Motivation for the use of such historicist references, however, is not primarily anchored in the past, but is open to a critical and often even painful investigation of the present. After all, the situations, events, processes and constant pressure that grew out of a totalitarian ideological and instrumental framework - elements which gradually deformed, and ultimately destroyed, the basic ethical standards of both the community and each individua! - still insidiously affect our everyday lives, even in today&apos,s new context.

Mathematical Simulation of Blast Furnace Operation,"The chapter deals with possibilities of mathematical modelling of blast furnace operation. The chapter summarizes various models for evaluation of blast furnace operation. It presents experience with statistic and balance models, with a model of thermodynamical balance of reduction processes and a model of dynamic balance of counter-current resulting in mathematical model of coke degradation in blast furnace. Beside it, the chapter is aimed at modelling of kinetics of reduction processes. It presents a methodology developed at VŠB - Technical University of Ostrava for interpretation of laboratory tests carried out according to international standards such as ISO 4695, 4969-1, 2. The designed model uses laboratory tests results as inputs for mathematical simulation of the material processing in blast furnace aggregate. The model calculates kinetic constants of changes in iron oxides concentration during non-direct reduction and estimates coke consumption for it. It presents simulation of reduction gas consumption regarding to ratio of direct reduction in time. It carries out simulation for one component and two components blast furnace feedstock to find easily the optimum of production process.",0.0,"Jursová, Simona:Pustějovská, Pavlína:Brožová, Silvie:Bilík, Jiří","Ironmaking and Steelmaking Processes: Greenhouse Emissions, Control, and Reduction",4,medium,high,1,0,medium,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Programme to reduce energy poverty in the Czech Republic,"In recent years, household expenditures on energy consumption have significantly increased. Consequently, the number of households that cannot afford to keep their homes adequately warm in winter or adequately cool in summer has increased as well. Such households are affected by energy poverty. The main goal of the paper is to examine existing approaches to energy poverty including energy poverty indicators and to compare system of support for energy poor households in the Czech Republic and in the United Kingdome. Another goal is to describe the most endangered types of households needing government support and to draft possible measures and programme to minimise the impact of energy poverty. The energy poor households that need government support were detected based on aggregated statistics of Housing Budget Survey and a comparison of the current situation. According to th introduced model, the number of households under energy poverty is 16% in the Czech Republic. Existing support programmes were examined to determine their potential use.

Sustainable supply chains are modeled as network systems with multiple agents, which are evaluated according to multiple criteria. It is usually impossible to optimize all criteria together in a given system. Searching for a better portfolio of resources leads to reshaping of given system boundaries and better criteria values.

"Precision medicine in medical oncology: hope, disappointment and reality","During the past 20 years, targeted therapy based on the understanding of tumor biology has been complementing or even replacing cytotoxic agents that have dominated pharmacotherapy of cancer since the conception of medical oncology. Unfortunately, the fact that targeted therapies with potential to induce cure or at least substantially prolong survival are still not available for many common solid tumors results in skepticism or even nihilism. On the one hand, biomarker research is not keeping pace with the introduction of new agents, while on the other hand, effective drugs are still not available for many potential molecular targets associated with malignant transformation and tumor progression. However, targeted therapies have already transformed the natural history and clinical outcomes not only in patients with rare malignancies like gastrointestinal stromal tumor but also with many common tumors, e.g. breast cancer, malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer or renal cell carcinoma.

Analysis of Fatigue Crack Growth Rate Data in an Aircraft 7175-T7351 Al-Alloy Generated at Different Accredited Laboratories with Probability Life Assessment Example,"Estimation of safety and reliability of engineering structures and components containing cracks or crack-like defects is one of the most important application field of fracture mechanics particularly in components, where limited defects can be accepted. Such design philosophy is usually called ""damage tolerance"", formerly ""safe life"". In such cases, safety and reliability of further operation, residual life assessment and specification of interval of damage development inspections are important issues. Existing exact knowledge on fatigue crack growth (FCG) parameters is an essential condition. Results of FCG measurement in an Al 7175-T7351 alloy of a particularly high homogeneity, carried out as a part of the Proficiency Test Program organized by Exova in France are presented in this work. Results were evaluated in terms of parameters C and m of the Paris dependence in the stable growth region. To pass the test program successfully, a particular attention was paid to improve and verify direct current potential drop (DCPD) method being used for the crack length measurement. In the paper, the results of the FCG measurements generated by different participating laboratories were analyzed. A distinct correlation between C and m values, so called ""coupling"", was found and demonstrated. Some paradoxes of the assessment of laboratories were addressed, namely the fact that a laboratory assessed as unacceptable concerning one of the parameters generated much more accurate and useful data than another laboratory with a better assessment. Eventually, the results including their scatter were used to provide an example of probabilistic assessment of a simple beam residual life to show practical actual impacts of the scatter on the life assessment.",20501.0,"Černý, Ivo",Journal of Multiscale Modeling,4,low,high,1,0,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Philological Interpretation of Dramatic Text. Cesare Pavese's The Mountain.,"The chapter ""Philological interpretation of dramatic text"" interprets the Czech translation Skála of the original Italian dramatic text La rupe (The Mountain) by Cesare Pavese and is a supplement to author’s dissertation. At first, there is a brief introduction of the text. Then there has been noted that the interpretation of texts is a crucial part of linguistic research. Furthermore, the historical path that has been chosen by the author to be followed in this endeavour has been described. The interpretation of the text Skála begins with very general levels of the text. On this general level, dimensions, domains and actors or agonists, who find themselves within these semantic fields, can be identified. Then the interpretation of a dramatic text according to Jiří Veltruský is provided, showing how signs change their values in different domains.

Dynamic thermal rating of transmission lines: A review,"Electrical load growth and the addition of renewable energy generation occur at a rate that can outpace transmission development. As a consequence, transmission lines may become constrained. To accommodate load growth or distributed generation connections, one option is to operate existing transmission facilities up to their actual physical capacity rather than a conservative estimate of line capacity. Dynamic thermal rating of transmission lines provides actual current-carrying capacity of overhead lines based on real-time operating conditions. Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DTLR) approaches vary significantly from one study to another in implementation, objectives and outcomes. Existing literature has presented several methodologies for DTLR adoption. This paper provides a comprehensive study of the literature on DTLR.

Traps of English as a Target Language in Legal Translation,"English has become the main language of communication in most subject areas in the globalized world. However, unlike other fields of human activities, law has been still quite resistant to globalizing forces coming from various directions. As long as different countries exist as autonomous and sovereign entities, their legal systems remain confined to their geographically delimited area, substantially influenced by the history, culture and tradition of the respective area on the one hand, and by the language used there as a means of communication on the other. As a result, the English used in common law would always be the navel of all English varieties used in the legal domain. Whatever variety of legal English one encounters, it always stems from the ""original"" legal English, i.e. that of common law. Certain jurilinguistic aspects may be expanded upon, some pushed out, and others added. When a legal system uses English as its official language, the scope of modification of, or even departure from, classical common-law English would depend on the system's philosophical and conceptual remoteness from common law. Translating legal texts into English requires that a translator should make a qualified decision with respect to a variety of legal English. The analysis should be aimed at choosing the best possible ""variety"" of legal English at all ""linguistic"" levels - grammatical (morphology and syntax), semantic and conceptual (relevant terminological choice), textual (relevant text types/genres) and pragmatic (considering potential addressees). The decision relating to ""which legal English"" should be used may often be motivated by the type of target legal system (e.g. common law, continental law, sharia, etc.) and by an envisaged ultimate recipient of the translated text (whether the recipient has any legal background, previous experience in legal transactions conducted in English, etc.).",0.0,"Chromá, Marta",Comparative Legilinguistics - International Journal for Legal Communication,4,low,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Software-based support to decision-making process regarding the selection of concrete suppliers,"An important issue that should be considered during the construction process is to organize the concrete supply for building site.

In common practice, the effectiveness of supplier selection mainly relies on the intuition of a construction manager. The aim of this paper is to propose a software-based methodology to better support a decision-making process regarding the selection of concrete suppliers.

The pasture was divided into two grazing sub-localities: P1 (Nar) with a dominance of Nardus stricta and Avenella flexuosa and P2 (Des) with a dominance of Deschampsia cespitosa. For grazing, Highland Cattle were used with a stocking rate up to 1 livestock unit per ha and year. The floristic compositions of the plots were evaluated and changes in the species richness analysed by regression. After six years of restored grazing, it was found that the overall species richness was enhanced and a higher dominance of rare and endangered species was found.

Residual neuromuscular block in paediatric anaesthesia,"Background: Residual neuromuscular blockade (RNB) in postoperative period is frequent (26-88%) and it is associated with negative impact on perioperative morbidity. The safety cut-off measured by accelerometry is currently defined as Train-of-four ratio (TOFr) &gt,= 0.9. The primary outcome of the study was detect the incidence of RNB measured just prior extubation in the operating room (OR) (according to pragmatic trial design) and the secondary outcome was the incidence of the RNB in postanaethesia care unit (PACU). Methods: After Ethics Committee (10/2016) approval, paediatric patients (1.1.2017-31.12.2017) undergoing surgery in general anaesthesia with muscle relaxation were included in the study. The level of blockade was measured just prior to extubation in OR (patient eligible for extubation according to the anesthesiologist) and after arrival at PACU with acceleromtery - TOF-Watch(R)SX (Organon, Inc, West Orange, NJ).

Education in nature programmes in the Czech Republic since 1989,"In this chapter we describe the cultural importance of sustaining Czech outdoor traditions and particularly summer camps, post WWII Soviet suppression. There was significant change post 1989 involving commercialisation, which impacted formal education at all levels. Non-formal organisations delivering &apos,education in nature&apos, programmes and traditional culturally unique turistika activities re-engaged and adapted their practices, and commercial outdoor companies were formed, which did not exist before 1989. Charles University&apos,s Faculty of Physical Education and Sport has continued to be at the forefront of developing connections between turistika traditions, education in nature programmes, and adapting new trends from abroad. Palacky University in Olomouc, through its Faculty of Physical Culture has also had a similar outdoor approach focused on promoting experiential education.

Influence of linseed oil on the microstructure and composition of lime and lime-metakaolin pastes after a long curing time,"This study investigates the effect of linseed oil on the microstructure of lime and lime-metakaolin pastes after 68 months of curing under controlled conditions. The hydrophobicity imparted by linseed oil to the pastes’ bulk was confirmed by measuring water drops’ contact angle. The results of thermal analysis, Xray powder diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that linseed oil significantly hindered the carbonation reaction in both lime and lime-metakaolin pastes and promoted the development of amorphous phases. The obtained results also indicated that linseed oil could foster the pozzolanic reaction in the lime-metakaolin system by stabilizing and/or promoting the development of hydration products resulting in reduced shrinkage in comparison with the reference.",20501.0,"Nunes, Cristiana Lara:Mácová, Petra:Frankeová, Dita:Ševčík, Radek:Viani, Alberto",Construction and Building Materials,4,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Use of Biofeedback to Increase The Resilience and Mental Health of Supersonic Pilots,"Pilots operate in a high-risk environment rich in potential stressors, which negatively affect aviation safety and the mental health of pilots. In the research conducted, the pilots were offered mental training biofeedback therapy. Biofeedback is an objective tool to measure physiological responses to stress. After only six sessions, all of the pilots tested showed significant differences between their initial condition and their condition after therapy. The biggest improvement was found in decreased heart rate (in 83.3% of tested pilots) and respiration rate (66.7%), which are the best indicators of anxiety states and panic attacks. To incorporate all of the variables, we correlated the measured physiological state of the pilots with their personality traits. Surprisingly, we found a high correlation with peripheral temperature and confidence (0.98) and with heart rate and aggressiveness (0.97).

Strain Dependency of Poisson's Ratio of SLS Printed Auxetic Lattices Subjected to Quasi-Static and Dynamic Compressive Loading,"This paper deals with experimental investigation into a strain-rate dependent function of Poisson's ratio of three auxetic structures subjected to compressive loading. The missing rib, the 2D re-entrant honeycomb, and the 3D re-entrant honeycomb lattices printed using selective laser sintering from powdered SS316L austenitic steel are investigated. The samples are subjected to uni-axial compression under quasi-static conditions and dynamic conditions using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). The deforming specimens are optically observed in order to apply a digital image correlation for evaluation of the in-plane displacement and strain fields. From the calculated strain fields, the function of Poisson's ratio is calculated for each experiment using different methods taking specific regions of interest of the specimen microstructures into account. The obtained functions of Poisson's ratio are plotted for each microstructure and strain-rate. The analysis of the results shows that the strain-rate has a significant influence on the deformation characteristics of all the investigated microstructures yielding differences in the magnitude of the minima of Poisson's ratio and the differences in the maximum overall compressive strain, where the lattices are still auxetic.",20501.0,"Fíla, Tomáš:Koudelka, Petr:Zlámal, Petr:Falta, Jan:Adorna, Marcel:Luksch, J.:Neuhäuserová, Michaela:Jiroušek, Ondřej",Advanced Engineering Materials,4,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men in the Czech Republic, 2016: high time for targeted action","Reported incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the Czech Republic increased steeply over the past decade from 90 new cases in 2005 to 266 in 2015. This increase is almost exclusively attributed to sexual transmissions between men who have sex with men (MSM). In 2015, there were 79% (n=210) newly diagnosed cases among MSM, 17% (n=45)were attributed to heterosexual transmission and 1% (n=3) to people who inject drugs. Interventions targeted at MSM have not yet been prioritised in the broadly focused national HIV prevention strategy which this is envisaged to change in the programme set out for 2018 to 2022. The national budget for HIV prevention has been reduced, however, and this remains. Availability of voluntary counselling and testing has decreased substantially in the past decade. Post-and pre-exposure prophylaxis for sexual intercourse among MSM are not part of the HIV prevention policy and the concept of treatment as prevention is not fully recognised. Provision of a combined prevention strategy with a focus on MSM, reflecting the above factors including stigmatisation, should contribute to reverse the development of a concentrated HIV epidemic among MSM in the Czech Republic.",30303.0,"Mravčík, Viktor:Pitoňák, Michal:Hejzák, Robert:Janíková, Barbara:Procházka, Ivo",Eurosurveillance,4,low,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, social networks are rarely used at lower level schools. Our research aims at examining Social Media in Classroom Education and deals with implementation of social media in elementary schools. The results showed that schools are interested in the use of social media in instruction but they are also aware of potential risks. Safety of pupils on social networks is one of the main reasons why schools are cautious to implement social media into instruction. We intended to propose appropriate teaching methods and organizational forms of instruction supported by social media.

Understanding nutrient throughput of operational RAS farm effluents to support semi-commercial aquaponics: Easy upgrade possible beyond controversies,"The present research attempted to address a key industry-level question amidst Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) waste throughput and aquaponics limitations controversies. Nutrient throughput of three operational RAS farms with progressive size proportions (16, 130, 1400 m(3)), aquaculture intensity (24, 62, 86 kg stock m(-3)) were studied. Results suggest - daily total efflux and potency of nutrients in effluents should not be generalized, extreme variability exists. Consistencies of nutrients in wastewater (except N, Ca and Na) are higher than in sludge. Asynchrony between patterns of nutrient loading and effluent nutrient concentrations exist for secondary macronutrients and micronutrients (S, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, B, Mo). Macronutrient output generally increases with increasing farm size and culture intensity but same cannot be said for micronutrients. Deficiency in wastewater can be completely masked using raw or mineralized sludge, usually containing 3-17 times higher nutrient concentrations. RAS effluents (wastewater and sludge combined) contain adequate N, P, Mg, Ca, S, Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni to meet most aquaponic crop needs. K is generally deficient requiring a full-fledged fertilization. Micronutrients B, Mo are partly sufficient and can be easily ameliorated by increasing sludge release. The presumption surrounding &apos,definite&apos, phyto-toxic Na levels in RAS effluents should be reconsidered - practical solutions available too. No threat of heavy metal accumulation or discharge was observed. Most of the &apos,well-known&apos, operational influences failed to show any significant predictable power in deciding nutrient throughput from RAS systems. Calibration of nutrient output from operational RAS farms may be primarily focused around six predictors we identified. Despite inherent complexity of effluents, the conversion of RAS farms to semi commercial aquaponics should not be deterred by nutrient insufficiency or nutrient safety arguments. Incentivizing RAS farm wastes through semi-commercial aquaponics should be encouraged - sufficient and safe nutrients are available.",40103.0,"Lunda, Roman:Roy, Koushik:Másílko, Jan:Mráz, Jan",Journal of Environmental Management,4,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Live-Cell High Content Screening in Drug Development,"In the past decade, automated microscopy has become an important tool for the drug discovery and development process. The establishment of imaging modalities as screening tools depended on technological breakthroughs in the domain of automated microscopy and automated image analysis. These types of assays are often referred to as high content screening or high content analysis (HCS/HCA). The driving force to adopt imaging for drug development is the quantity and quality of cellular information that can be collected and the enhanced physiological relevance of cellular screening compared to biochemical screening. Most imaging in drug development is performed on fixed cells as this allows uncoupling the preparation of the cells from the acquisition of the images. Live-cell imaging is technically challenging, but is very useful for many aspects of the drug development pipeline such as kinetic studies of compound mode of action or to analyze the motion of cellular components. Most vendors of HCS microscopy systems offer the option of environmental chambers and onboard pipetting on their platforms. This reflects the wish and desire of many customers to have the ability to perform live-cell assays on their HCS automated microscopes. This book chapter summarizes the challenges and advantages of live-cell imaging in drug discovery.

A database of metallic materials emissivities and absorptivities for cryogenics,"The paper introduces a database of low temperature total hemispherical emissivities and absorptivities of various metallic materials obtained from measurements conducted in our laboratory. Both quantities are measured in dependence on the temperature of thermal radiation starting at 20 K and ending between 120 K and 320 K. The database contains 58 results from measurements of 45 different samples such as bulk metals, foils and coated plastic or metallic surfaces. The database includes samples with surfaces finished by mechanical or chemical polishing, fine turning, sand blasting, abrading, etching and gold deposition and covers to some extent effects of material purity and surface aging.

Efficient One-Stage Bio-Oil Upgrading over Sulfided Catalysts,"Efficient upgrading of fast pyrolysis bio-oils into products that can be easily integrated into existing refinery complexes remains to be a challenge particularly from the stability of a catalyst performance point of view. Several NiMo catalysts, mainly alumina-supported, were either prepared or acquired and used in hydrotreating of bio-oil from ablative fast pyrolysis of straw. The experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at 340 °C and 4 MPa and lasted for 80 h. Detailed monitoring of the key physicochemical properties allowed comparing the performance of the catalysts and assessing its changes with the time-on-stream (TOS). The quality of all products deteriorated with the increasing TOS evidencing gradual loss of performance. Nonetheless, the product quality over the best catalysts remained suitable for further refinery upgrading by coprocessing during the 80-h TOS. Distillation of a hydrotreated bio-oil into naphtha, gas oil, and atmospheric residue allowed obtaining further insights into oxygenates present and their distribution.

Astrophysics of “Extreme Solar-Like Stars,"Only a few red dwarf flaring stars in the solar neighbourhood have undergone exceptional events called superflares. They have been detected with high-energy satellites (Swift) and have been proven to be powerful events (both in intensity and energy) and potentially hazardous for any extra terrestial life. The physics of these events can be understood as an extrapolation of the (much) weaker activity already occurring in the most powerful solar flares occurring in the Sun. Nevertheless, the origin (why?) of these superflares occur isncurrently unknown. A recent study presents the optical and X-ray long-term evolution of the emission by the super-flare from the red-dwarf star DG CVn undertaken in 2 014.

Structure and magnetic properties of synthesized fine cerium dioxide nanoparticles,"Cerium dioxide, which is diamagnetic in its bulk crystalline fluorite form, exhibits ferromagnetism when prepared as a nanopowder. This characteristic has recently been ascribed to localized electron spin moments formed at oxygen vacancies near the nanoparticle surfaces. In the present study, a number of structure-sensitive and magnetic methods were applied to CeO2 nanopowders prepared from the carbonate precursor by treatment at different calcination temperatures. The low-temperature magnetization measurements subsequently performed via 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed the presence of small amounts of iron impurities in the samples as well as in the chemicals used to prepare them.

Computing and Translation: An Overview for Technical Communicators,"This chapter focuses on the theme of computers in translation practices, including the advent and proliferation of machine translation (MT). The purpose of the chapter is to introduce technical communicators to central concepts that underlie translation, translation practice, and the role translation plays in the global communication business. The chapter first presents a general overview of how such factors developed over time, then it examines the basic terms and concepts of technology in translation. This includes discussions of cost, finances, and billing considerations as well as the actual benefit technology yields in communication practice. Reviewing such factors can help technical communicators better understand such procedures and contextualize them in relation to technical communication practices. The chapter also provides technical communicators with practical hints to gain an understanding of translation from the perspective of content creators and/or project managers. (Such information can help contextualize translation within workflow processes and production practices.) The chapter then concludes with a discussion of what the future in the field of technology in translation is likely to hold. This discussion includes considerations relating to the eventually endangered status of non-professional and non-competitive translators, whose work (in specific situations) might increasingly be substituted by (MT) technology. The examination of these topics in this way can provide technical communicators with key insights that can help guide their current and future practices relating to working with translation and translators.",60203.0,"Svoboda, Tomáš",Translation and Localization.

Neural and neuronal discoordination in schizophrenia: From ensembles through networks to symptoms,"Despite the substantial knowledge accumulated by past research, the exact mechanisms of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and causal treatments still remain unclear. Deficits of cognition and information processing in schizophrenia are today often viewed as the primary and core symptoms of this devastating disorder. These deficits likely result from disruptions in the coordination of neuronal and neural activity. The aim of this review is to bring together convergent evidence of discoordinated brain circuits in schizophrenia at multiple levels of resolution, ranging from principal cells and interneurons, neuronal ensembles and local circuits, to large‐scale brain networks. We show how these aberrations could underlie deficits in cognitive control and other higher order cognitive‐behavioural functions. Converging evidence from both animal models and patients with schizophrenia is presented in an effort to gain insight into common features of deficits in the brain information processing in this disorder, marked by disruption of several neurotransmitter and signalling systems and severe behavioural outcomes.",10608.0,"Krajcovic, Branislav:Fajnerová, Iveta:Horáček, Jiří:Kelemen, Eduard:Kubik, Stepan:Svoboda, Jan:Stuchlík, Aleš",Acta Physiologica,4,high,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
HARDNESS OF CONTINUOUS LOCAL SEARCH: QUERY COMPLEXITY AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC LOWER BOUNDS,"Local search proved to be an extremely useful tool when facing hard optimization problems (e.g., via the simplex algorithm, simulated annealing, or genetic algorithms). Although powerful, it has its limitations: there are functions for which exponentially many queries are needed to find a local optimum. In many contexts, the optimization problem is defined by a continuous function which might offer an advantage when performing the local search. This leads us to study the following natural question: How hard is continuous local search? The computational complexity of such search problems is captured by the complexity class CLS [C. Daskalakis and C. H. Papadimitriou, Proceedings of SODA&apos,11, 2011], which is contained in the intersection of PLS and PPAD, two important subclasses of TFNP (the class of NP search problems with a guaranteed solution). In this work, we show the first hardness results for CLS (the smallest nontrivial class among the currently defined subclasses of TFNP). Our hardness results are in terms of black-box (where only oracle access to the function is given) and white-box (where the function is represented succinctly by a circuit). In the black-box case, we show instances for which any (computationally unbounded) randomized algorithm must perform exponentially many queries in order to find a local optimum. In the white-box case, we show hardness for computationally bounded algorithms under cryptographic assumptions. Our results demonstrate a strong conceptual barrier precluding design of efficient algorithms for solving local search problems even over continuous domains. As our main technical contribution we introduce a new total search problem which we call END-OF-METERED-LINE. The special structure of END-OF-METERED-LINE enables us to (1) show that it is contained in CLS, (2) prove hardness for it in both the black-box and the white-box setting, and (3) extend to CLS a variety of results previously known only for PPAD.",10201.0,"Hubáček, Pavel:Yogev, Eylon",SIAM Journal on Computing,4,high,high,1,1,high,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the textile industry, effective color control and communication between designer, dyer and retailer are critical. Color communication throughout the supply chain is a dynamic process.

At that time the CNB&apos,s inflation target was set in terms of so-called net inflation, but since 2002 it has been set in terms of inflation expressed as a change in the consumer price index. In addition to standard instruments, the CNB used foreign exchange interventions from November 2013 to April 2017 to devalue the Czech currency in an effort to increase the price level and thus achieve the inflation target, although practical experience with the use of the exchange rate as an instrument of unconventional monetary policy were limited.

Professionals who look after parents who have experienced perinatal loss often point out the demanding nature of the care, stress, and strong emotions which affect not only the parents but also caregivers. Therefore, the book emphasizes the importance of systematic mental hygiene and care for the mental health of caregivers. The text is divided into two main parts. The first part of the book focuses on theoretical didactic aspects of psychosocial perinatal palliative care and provides evidence for teaching this challenging topic. The second part presents practical exercises that are effective for achieving long-lasting change in the learners&apos, behaviour. The publication is intended for teachers, lecturers, and facilitators who are engaged in teaching students of medical disciplines (midwives, neonatology or general nurses, medics) or social sciences (social workers, clinical psychologists, theologians, etc.). It also aims at the education of postgraduate students and continuing the professional development of experts who experience perinatal loss in practice. Moreover, the publication is suitable for organizers of educational workshops in maternity hospitals and neonatal departments.",,"Ratislavová, Kateřina:Hrušková, Zuzana",,5,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Availability of care in patients with secondary lymphedema after breast surgery,"Secondary lymphatic edema is regular complication of breast cancer. In the literature it is shown that reduces the quality of life of women who suffer from this disease with the medical and social treatment is long and arduous. Its principle is complex decongestive therapy, which is performed by specially trained physicians and therapists in lymfocenters. These centers for the treatment of lymfedema are usually located in larger cities, so their availability is difficult for some patients. In this work, the authors deal with evaluating the availability of treatment after the transport to lymfocentra including what the distance is still tolerable for the patient and it is too burdened.

Only Vanished Footprints or a Permanent Legacy? Exile Media and the Central European Public Space,"Chapter attempts to place publishing activity by Czechoslovaks in exile into the wider Central European context. Refugees began to publish exile periodicals in the West soon after the Communist takeover in February 1948. This initially served specifically for providing information to the exile community. Of most interest were those which perceived their public in the countries behind the Iron Curtain. The text focuses on several examples from exile magazines which focused not only on the situation in Czechoslovakia, but also dealt with additional issues as well as on developments throughout Eastern Europe. This was specifically the magazine Svědectví (Testimony) which was established in the autumn of 1956, this being the time of the Hungarian Uprising. The occupation of Czechoslovakia by the armies of the Warsaw Pact in August 1968 resulted in another large-scale wave of immigration to the West. The new exile generation was particularly productive in the sphere of information, publishing and culture in general. Listy (Pages), published in Rome, ranked among the most significant Czechoslovak exile periodicals. Czechoslovak, Poland and Hungarian immigrants began, however, to move away from closely defined national borders and started preparing projects with an international focus.

Principle of Proportionality as a Product of European Legal Culture,"European as well as American legal scholarship in the 20th century described several doctrines and approaches of how to solve conflicts of fundamental rights and public goods. None of them, however, have received such attention worldwide, both in academia and in judicial practice, as the principle of proportionality. The essence of the original meaning of the principle of proportionality is based on the constitutional requirement to tailor regulatory means to envisaged ends. The aim of this chapter is, however, neither a description of the 'triumph of proportionality' in Post-War jurisprudence nor a structural description and listing problems concerning the application of this principle.

Status of a Quality Management System in the Czech Republic as a Condition for Business Competitiveness,"Purpose of the article: Corporate management understands the importance of proving the quality of their products as well as other aspects, particularly environmental and safety issues in business connections and their possible negative impact on the company's competitiveness and image. Methodology/methods: A data analysis was carried out based on a questionnaire research conducted in a selection group of Czech businesses with the objective to identify the reasons for introducing and using a management system, or to identify difficulties and problems in introducing it. The questionnaire research was statistically processed using analytic classification, hypotheses testing as well as a correlation analysis. Scientific aim: The objective of the research was to validate or invalidate the hypotheses concerning the measures taken by a business in implementing and maintaining a quality management system (QMS), problems in its implementation, and to analyse competitive advantages and influence on the image. Findings: The research results confirmed that internal reasons for QMS implementation prevail in national businesses. Nevertheless, the main problem is the complexity of QMS/ understanding of the QMS by employees. An implemented QMS motivates the personnel, however, only a small number of enterprises use it to motivate their employees. The main benefits quoted by the respondents were improved company process management and relations between the processes, increased customer satisfaction as well as improved corporate image. Conclusions: A quality management system helps organisations to introduce system and order. Corporate processes are systematically managed, which significantly contributes to meeting the business objectives of a company. Having integrated the implemented QMS in their organisation, the respondents demonstrated they can effectively work with it and flexibly react to the changes faced in the present market environment.",0.0,"Kovářová, Kateřina",Trends Economics and Management,5,low,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Aspects of Antisocial Behavior in Relation to Emotion Understanding and Parenting Style in Slovak and South African Early Adolescents.,"The study is aimed at investigating understanding of emotions in relation to aspects of antisocial behavior and substance use with respect to parenting styles. Subjects were 397 early adolescents from two countries (Slovakia and South Africa). We examined, if similarities or differences exist in comparison of both samples. Variables were measured by the Situational Test of Emotional Understanding (STEU) and selected parts from the Social and Health Assessment (SAHA) questionnaire (namely the Antisocial behavior, Prosocial behavior, Beliefs legitimizing aggression, Parenting, School attachment, and Academic motivation scales). The obtained results only partly support expected significant associations between higher level of emotion understanding and lower level of involvement in antisocial behavior. On the contrary the linkage between lower level of understanding of emotions and higher rate of negative forms of behavior was manifested. These relations were only evident with Slovak adolescents, but not with their South African counterparts.

Training of Pilots Using Flight Simulator and its Impact on Piloting Precision,"One of the basic requirements to obtain pilot license is to demonstrate flying skills as to perform maneuvers and procedures with a required level of expertise. Considering the involvement of flight simulators in basic pilot trainings, one may ask how this impacts the extent of real flights necessary to acquire the required flying proficiency. This article focuses on the evaluation of precision (or error rate) of flight maneuvers performed over the course training of pilots. A sample of 35 student pilots was chosen for the study. Flight schedules and the training itself was adjusted for the purposes of this study, while the emphasis was put on the uniformity of flights and their conditions. Participants completed 11 flight hours on a flight simulator and one flight hour on the Diamond DA40 aircraft, followed by further three hours on a simulator and two flight hours in real traffic. The performed maneuvers included 180° climbing and descending turns with 30° bank at vertical velocity of 500 ft/min. During the flight hours, deviations from the requested flight parameters were recorded by the instructor. The results show that maneuver performance error ratio gradually decreases, however then significantly increases with the switch to the real aircraft compared to flight simulator, and again decreases during flights in air traffic. The findings suggest that the use of flight simulators as a tool for practicing flying skills appears reasonable, as well as that monitoring of performance precision may prove as a useful basis for adjusting the pilot training process.",,"Socha, Vladimír:Socha, L.:Szabo, Stanislav:Hána, Karel:Gazda, J.:Kimličková, M.:Vajdová, I.:Maďorán, A.:Hanáková, Lenka:Němec, Vladimír:Puškáš, T.:Schlenker, Jakub:Rozenberg, R.",,5,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The influence of particle size of cement and different additives on the properties of Portland cement pastes.,"The consumption of concrete as a building material is still increasing over the world. Concrete production is closely associated with CO2 and other greenhouse gases emissions. The reduction of these emissions can be achieved by a higher utilization of secondary raw materials in cement mixtures. Particle size is an important factor for more effective use of these materials. This work is focused on the calorimetric determination of the effect of particle size of cement, finely ground granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), high-temperature fly ash (FA) and fluidized fly ash (FFA) on the Portland cement hydration. Effect of particle size on the hydration of pure cement pastes and pastes with the addition of secondary raw materials is monitored by isoperibolic calorimetry.

LABORATORY HEAT TREATMENT OF THE SHELL MATERIAL OF THE CENTRIFUGALLY CAST ROLL FOR THE LAST FINISHING STAND OF HOT STRIP MILLS,"The rolls for the hot rolling finishing stands are cast centrifugally as two or three-layer rolls. The working layer is called a shell. The material of the shell is selected according to the position of the respective roll in the final finishing stand of the rolling mill. Typically, a combination of rolls made of a high-chromium cast iron + indefinite cast iron or high-speed steel + indefinite část iron is commonly used. Great attention has been paid to indefinite cast iron in recent years and this material received a number of modifications that led to the increase of material properties up to 20% in comparison to the ordinary indefinite cast iron. But the goals of the new generation of material for hot rollers were chosen higher: increasing of production about 30% and more. This material has specific physical properties, heat treatment requirements as well as rolling mill requirements as is stated in the paper. It is expected that introduction of this material will reduce the difference between wear of the front and finishing stands, which can extend rolling campaigns and have a positive effect on the reduction rolls exchanges, the grinding of the rolls and the reduction of downtime.",20501.0,"Válek, Tomáš:Kuboň, Zdeněk:Kosňovská, Jana",Archives of Metallurgy and Materials,5,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Telemetry System Utilization for Stress Monitoring of Pilots During Training,"Air transport development brings an increased focus on the safety of piloting. The safety conditions can be assessed by mental workload. Psychic discomfort or excessive stress on pilots can negatively influence the course of flights. Therefore it appears convenient to monitor such parameters, which represent the mental wellbeing, or discomfort of a pilot. Since physiological measurements can provide a good information about mental workload or stress, this work primarily focuses on the observation of the change in heart rate, as it is an indicator of stress during the training of pilots, using the designed modular telemetry system. Another aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of a change in the avionic data visualization. This can have an unfavorable effect on the piloting of an airplane. This work, based on the evaluation of heart rate shows, that the switch from analog visualization to glass cockpit creates increased levels of stress in pilots, which was proved for all examined subjects except one. Significant level of correlation in the heart beat rate change in subjects in the course of training was also discovered.",,"Socha, L.:Hanáková, Lenka:Socha, Vladimír:Lališ, Andrej:Rozenberg, R.:Hána, Karel",,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Chemical Determinands of Freshwater Ecosystem Functioning,"Chemical equilibria in surface waters stem from complex interactions between physical background and living components of ecosystems.

This chapter illustrates how the monitoring of standard parameters, such as oxygen, pH, conductivity, major ions, nutrients, and carbon, can lead to an interpretation of key aspects of the functioning of major ecosystem processes and how chemical constituents may affect the distribution of aquatic organisms. This requires understanding principles that underlie available measurement techniques and it demands a certain familiarity with the intrinsic variability of parameter values and of their chemical interaction. It is not required that field scientists be able to conduct detailed chemical assessments, but all should be able to collect samples yielding high-quality data. Therefore, detailed advice on chemical monitoring practice is provided, including sample collection, filtering, sample processing, and is discussed with the context of several case studies.",10617.0,"Pacini, Nic:Pechar, Libor:Harper, D.",Freshwater Ecology and Conservation: Approaches and Techniques,5,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The perception of media messages by preschool children,"The purpose of the study was to ascertain how preschool children consume media, which types of media content they are sensitive to and how children affect the shopping behavior of their parents. In other words, the study aimed at revealing whether distinctions occur among the selection of the media, among preferences of media products and forms, among concepts within advertising, among the attractiveness of media contents, among the types of influence by advertising products and among the means by which boys and girls have impact on their parents. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is focused on the analyses of the perception of advertising messages and media consumption of children aged from two to seven years (N = 55) and their parents (N = 55) in the Czech Republic. The semi-structured interviews with the parents and children were used as the main research method. The children’s drawings focused on popular advertising were used as a supplementary method. The final findings were subjected to qualitative analyses – to thematic content analyses. Findings: The analyzed interviews have revealed four key factors which frame and express the Czech preschool children’s reception and consumption of the media and their consumer behavior: media, media format and media content choice of preschool children, ritualization of the media consumption processes in preschool children, identification of advertising appeals within the media content in preschool children, and influence of media (and a social and cultural environment) on shopping behavior of preschool children. The findings are summarized in the table and visualized in thematic map. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small, therefore, it is not possible to generalize the results to all preschool children. Originality/value: The study provides an explanation of the perception of media messages by preschool children from a broader perspective, from the children and their parents’ point of view.",50101.0,"Šramová, Blandína:Pavelka, Jiří",Young Consumers,5,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Smart method of agricultural drought regionalization: A winter wheat case study,"The occurrence of drought during flowering (usually from the end of May to the beginning of June) is the most hazardous timing in terms of the possible negative impact of agricultural drought on winter wheat, which is the most cultivated crop in the Czech Republic (about 800000 ha). Lack of water, often accompanied by high temperatures, negatively affects the number of grains in the wheat ear and the tissue development of the developing grain, with consequent impacts on yield and quality of product. With the use of a) long-term time series of agrometeorological data (1961–2010), b) long-term phenological time series of winter wheat (1981–2010), and c) soil conditions data (available water capacity of soils of the Czech Republic) for the arable soil, the ratio of actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration for the period of 1961–2010, used as an indicator of agricultural drought (lack of water) for wheat, was calculated. The innovative aspect of this categorization of the territory of the Czech Republic according to the risk of occurrence of agricultural drought for winter wheat is considering drought from the aspect of the plant, i.e., evaluation based on the actual consumption of water by the vegetation. This is a very sophisticated procedure. Frequently, water content in soils data, presented as an output of some models, do not fully indicate the possible negative impacts on yield generation because the plants themselves are typically not considered. The method used in this study is universally applicable and allows comparisons of regions at the local, regional, and supra-regional levels. For estimation of the development of agronomic drought in the future, the basic water balances in the growing seasons of 1961–2010 and 2071–2100 were compared using a climate scenario. The forecast indicates a significant deterioration of agricultural drought in the region with probable direct impacts on agricultural production.",10511.0,"Středa, Tomáš:Středová, Hana:Chuchma, Filip:Kučera, Josef:Rožnovský, Jaroslav",Contributions to Geophysics and Geodesy,5,high,high,1,1,high,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
How Rescher Failed to Fill the Fact/Value Gap,"In his (several times reprinted) article How Wide Is the Gap Between Facts and Values? N. Rescher aspires to clarify the long-lasting discussion on the ‘is-ought’ (‘fact-value’) gap by providing a framework in which the related arguments can be perspicuously articulated. He then argues that even if the logical gap may be real, the transition from factual premises to value conclusions is smoothly medi- ated by trivially true value statements. We scrutinize Rescher’s argumentation and show defects in the presented lines of reasoning. In particular, we argue that his tripartite division of statements (factual, evaluative, hybrid), as well as his em- phasis on the role of evaluative truisms, introduce serious problems that escape Rescher’s attention. We thus conclude that he failed to achieve his goals.",60301.0,"Kolář, Petr:Svoboda, Vladimír",Filozofie dnes,5,low,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Statistical Analysis of Detailed 3-D CFD LES Simulations with Regard to CCV Modeling,"The paper deals with statistical analysis of large amount of detailed 3-D CFD data in terms of cycle-to-cycle variations (CCVs). These data were obtained by means of LES calculations of many consecutive cycles. Due to non-linear nature of Navier-Stokes equation set, there is a relatively significant CCV. Hence, every cycle is slightly different – this leads to requirement to perform statistical analysis based on ensemble averaging procedure which enables better understanding of CCV in ICE including its quantification. The data obtained from the averaging procedure provides results on different space resolution levels. The procedure is applied locally, i.e., in every cell of the mesh. Hence there is detailed CCV information on local level – such information can be compared with RANS simulations. Next, volume/mass averaging provides information at specific locations – e.g., gap between electrodes of a spark plug. Finally, volume/mass averaging of the whole combustion chamber leads to global information which can be compared with experimental data or results of system simulation tools (which are based on 0-D/1-D approach).",0.0,"Vítek, Oldřich:Macek, Jan:Pavlovic, Z.",MECCA Journal of Middle European Construction and Design of Cars,5,medium,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Rural non-profit leaders and their (in)formal role in local development,"Current interest in place-based leadership is playing a crucial role in local development. It concerns mainly politicians and public servants. The role of non-profit leaders is still an under-researched topic. Thus, we ask the following research questions: Are rural areas with local action groups (LAGs) more attractive to people than those without? Within rural areas with LAGs, are those with a higher proportion of non-profit partners more attractive to people? On a sample of 6,262 Czech municipalities, we tested whether membership of municipalities in LAGs and non-profit leadership attributed to positive migration balance. We did it by the application of the propensity score matching method combined with the difference–indifference approach. We found positive estimates for both LAGs’ membership and non-profit leadership on the attractiveness of municipalities. The participation of non-profit leaders makes an important difference.

"Pyrolysis gases produced from individual and mixed PE, PP, PS, PVC, and PET-Part II: Fuel characteristics","The current energy industry relies heavily on fossil fuels. As reserves of fossil fuels are diminishing, the demands for alternative forms of energy are growing. Therefore, the search for alternative fuels is crucial. This article discusses pyrolysis gases generated from major plastics as possible future successors to fossil fuels. The novelty of this study lies in the comprehensive discussion of the fuel characteristics of different pyrolysis gases that are so far unpublished. The article builds on Part I, which predominantly focused on the production and physical properties of pyrolysis gases from plastics. Various properties are determined by combining experimental and mathematical methods. An interesting aspect of the gases produced from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is their high upper flammability limits, which are 61.46% on average. Gases from poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) are characterized by very high laminar burning velocities, with an average value of 178.62 cm s(-1), which is about five times higher than that of natural gas (NG). Gases produced from PVC at 500 and 700 degrees C have autoignition temperatures almost identical to that of NG. Furthermore, the results presented in this article show that, according to standards proposed by the California Air Resources Board and the Gas Research Institute, none of the pyrolysis gases are suitable fuels for gas engines, because the methane number of no gas meets the minimum value of 65 required in the EU and USA. This article discusses results valuable for determining the potential suitability of pyrolysis gases for use in power-engineering facilities, including combustion engines, and includes information on further research prospects.",20702.0,"Honus, Stanislav:Kumagai, Shogo:Molnár, Vieroslav:Fedorko, Gabriel:Yoshioka, Toshiaki",Fuel,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Plasma Technology in the Preservation and Cleaning of Cultural Heritage Objects,"The aim of the efforts of all professionals involved in the protection of tangible cultural heritage values is to prolong the existence of heritage objects in a time far beyond their natural lifetime. Cleaning can be considered as a key operation in the process of conservation. The removal of impurities and deposits of various origins and chemical compositions from the surfaces of various types of objects is a case-specific process. New methods and technologies, based on the use of knowledge about the effects of low-temperature plasma on various inorganic and organic materials, seem promising. They also provide environmentally friendly and human-like solutions (elimination of the replacement of organic, often toxic substances). It is also important to ensure the safety of conservation technologies for cultural heritage. Part of the work must not be only the setting of conditions that effectively remove unwanted substances from the material, but also the verification of possible adverse effects on the treated material, even in the long term regarding prolonging the lifetime of historical artefacts.

Fatigue properties of laser and hybrid laser-TIG welds of thermo-mechanically rolled steels,"The hybrid laser-tungsten inert gas welding technology was applied to butt weld 3-mm-thick S460MC and S700MC high-strength low-alloy steel sheets. The intent of low-current arc addition was to preheat the material to reduce extremely fast cooling rate accompanying laser welding. High-cycle fatigue tests were performed to evaluate the effect of welding conditions on fatigue behavior of S460MC and S700MC laser and hybrid welds. Both base materials exhibit approximately the same fatigue limit. However, corresponding samples with the weld behaved significantly different under cyclic loading. We demonstrated that the drop of their fatigue lifetime is caused by the combination of microstructural changes and especially by the presence of surface notches resulting from the welding process. The two series of both steels were tested to reveal the contribution of induced surface roughness and microstructural changes itself. The first one was in the as-welded condition. The second one had a smooth surface resulting from surface layer grinding after the welding. It was found, that the geometric notches created by the welding process are the determining factor in case of both tested steels. Testing of the ground samples showed, that in case of S460MC steel, the application of pre-heat did not improve the fatigue properties. On the other hand, the performed fatigue tests showed improved fatigue limit of ground series samples of the pre-heated S700MC steel, when compared with the conventional laser welding.",20301.0,"Šebestová, Hana:Horník, Petr:Mrňa, Libor:Jambor, M.:Horník, Vít:Pokorný, Pavel:Hutař, Pavel:Ambrož, Ondřej:Doležal, P.",Materials Science and Engineering A-Structural materials,5,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Discovering the Lean Production Secrets on the Verge of Industry 4.0,"The book is devoted to implementation of the Lean Production concept in conditions of existing macro- and microenvironmental trends at high-technology enterprises. The authors provide an in-depth analysis of such phenomena as globalization, economic integration and development, and their influence on the enterprise competitiveness. The authors go on to study the concept of “Industry 4.0”, assessing how it shapes market structures. As high-technology enterprises play an essential role in the advent of Industry 4.0, the book provides insight into benefits of implementing innovative managerial approaches at such enterprises – namely, the Lean Production concept. The authors demonstrate in detail the potential fields of the Lean Production application, its influence on the market value of a high-technology business. The proposed approaches to implementation of Lean Production, Lean Logistics, and development of the value-oriented strategy are supported by real cases, extensive and clear calculations, including an element-by-element analysis of financial statements from the point of Lean Production. Using the Lean Production concept, the authors illustrate how innovative managerial approaches not only generate additional profit, transform traditional cost centers into profit centers, create value – but also how such innovations refine the structure of the intellectual capital of an enterprise.

Thermal stability and bioavailability of bioactive compounds after baking of bread enriched with different onion by-products,"This study investigated the effects of the addition of onion waste fractions into gluten-free (GF) bread to promote its health benefits. 5% of the control (C) GF flour blend was replaced with three waste fractions in the form of: fried onion (FO), dried onion (DO) and onion peel (OP).

"Folklore Revival Movement of the Second Half of the 20th Century in Shifting Social, Cultural and Political Contexts","The folklore revival movement in its current meaning in the Czech Republic has its origin in the period after the Second World War when the communist party became the dominant power (after 1948) in the political system of former Czechoslovakia. The term folklore movement was used here to characterize the activities of ensembles of folk songs and dances in the second half of the 20th century, encompassing festivals, performances, competitions of staged forms of folk music and dance. On one hand, the folklore movement was an activity promoted and controlled by the political régime, on the other hand, considering the lack of opportunity for other similar activities, the folklore movement brought together people of diverse ways of thinking, creating conditions for the development of alternative ideas. This way the movement was at the same time a part of the official culture and a place of potential independent activities. Political situation in other European countries, both within the so called socialist block and outside, also had an impact on the folklore movements there. The aim of this symposium is to discuss the issue of the study in an international context with a comparison of the former communist countries and countries of the Western Europe. This comparison should provide various perspectives for considering to what extent the movement was the instrument of power and to what extent it was an opportunity to implement one´s own strategy. The attention has to be payed to folk ensembles and their specific role in a particular society.n",,"Stavělová, Daniela:Kratochvíl, Matěj:Vejvoda, Zdeněk:Gremlicová, D.",,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Working Memory of Future Military Leaders in the Process of Adaptation to their Professional Role and its Impact on Communication Competence Improvement,"Communication skills are considered by both theoreticians and military practitioners to be the key to serving as commander-leader. Their level in a particular individual is influenced, among other things, by the ability to consciously work with information, that is, the ability not only to acquire and transmit the information but, above all, to remember them, to be able to select essential from insignificant. Significant factors throughout the process are cognitive processes and declarative memory. High demands on memory capacity are placed on the individual even in the states of his own high physical and mental strain (burden). The authors of the article are of the opinion that the memory capabilities of military leaders should be purposefully identified and developed in the process of preparing leaders for their future professional role. Because the relationship between work performance and memory capabilities and commander's communication skills was not the subject of deeper exploration in the case of military leaders or commanders in the past, the authors of the contribution present some points for solving the problem. They also bring the results of the survey, which should provide sub-information on the level of working memory of future commanders in the state of their physical and mental burden for the needs of education.

Nanofibers in mucosal drug and vaccine delivery,"Successful mucosal administration and delivery of drugs still pose a great challenge. However, the possibility to deliver not only small drug molecules, but also macromolecular drugs and nanoparticles via mucosal surfaces represents a great opportunity. Rapid onset of drug action, avoidance of first-pass metabolism, and high immunocompetence of mucosa are some of the important features for mucosal drug and vaccine delivery. The use of mucoadhesive drug delivery systems, systems with fast-dissolving properties, and nanomaterials with mucus penetration properties are examples of successful strategies to achieve effective mucosal drug and vaccine delivery. Non-keratinised mucosa of the oral cavity, the nasal and vaginal mucosa represent favourable sites of drug administration. Polymer nanofibers have attracted much attention because of remarkable characteristics such as a large surface area to volume ratio and high porosity. Nanofibers have been extensively used for different biomedical applications including wound dressing, tissue engineering and drug delivery. Among their fabrication methods, the introduction of electrospinning technique was an important step towards achieving the goal of large scale industrial production of nanofiber-based drug delivery systems used in mucosal applications.

"Transformations of ferrates(IV,V,VI) in liquids: Mössbauer spectroscopy of frozen solutions","The kinetics and mechanism of ferrate(IV), (V) and (VI) transformations in water and in polar organic solvents (namely ethanol and tetrahydrofuran) have been investigated by the method of 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy of frozen solutions. Ethanol with a very limited amount of water under an inert atmosphere, significantly slows down the transformation reactions of ferrates(IV and V) and provides direct proof of the existence of intermediate states. Simultaneously, ethanol is oxidized to caboxylates in the close vicinity of the surface of ferrate crystallites as proven by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On the contrary, any transformation of ferrate(VI) in pure ethanol (with a very limited amount of water) was not observed. Mössbauer spectroscopy of frozen solutions enabled us to experimentally identify and quantify intermediates of ferrate(IV) and ferrate(V) transformations for the first time. Sodium ferrate(IV) in its tetrahedral form, Na4FeO4, undergoes a two-step charge disproportionation to Fe(III) and Fe(VI) via a Fe(V) intermediate without any evolution of oxygen in polar protic and aprotic solvents, specifically 2Fe(IV) → Fe(III) + Fe(V), and Fe(IV) + Fe(V) → Fe(III) + Fe(VI), i.e. in sum 3Fe(IV) → 2Fe(III) + Fe(VI). Ferrate(V) (K3FeO4) transforms to Fe(III) and Fe(VI) without any indication of the Fe(IV) intermediate within the detection limit of the method. In addition to a charge disproportionation reaction proceeding in polar liquids, 3Fe(V) → Fe(III) + 2Fe(VI), a competitive reduction of Fe(V) directly to Fe(III) accompanied by oxygen evolution takes place in water. Oxygen evolution was also measured for ferrate(IV and VI) transformations in water, but to a higher and a smaller extent compared to ferrate(V), respectively. The thermodynamics of the suggested ferrate(IV) and ferrate(V) transformation pathways was examined by DFT calculations.",21001.0,"Novák, Petr:Kolář, Michal:Machala, Libor:Machalová Šišková, Karolína:Karlický, František:Petr, Martin:Zbořil, Radek",PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,5,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since the Lisbon Treaty came into effect the Union as a whole has had a separate legal personality, similar to that of any other state but different because it is not a state. The definition of the statehood of an international organisation developed in relation to the inter-war League of Nations. Some thought that it was a utopia of a future society based on principles of humanity, mutual friendship between nations, and respect for the independence and territorial integrity of states.An international organisation based on high ideas and morals.

Consideration of the Joule-Thomson Effect for the Transport of Vapor through Anodic Alumina Membranes under Conditions of Capillary Condensation.,"Anodic alumina membranes have straight pores and a very uniform pore size distribution. Data on the permeance for the flow of isobutane vapors through anodic alumina membranes with pore diameters between 20 nm and 90 nm has been reported recently [Petukhov et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 120, 10982-10990, 2016]. For the upstream pressure approaching the saturation pressure, a sudden increase of the permeance was observed. Taking into account capillary condensation and assuming isothermal conditions within the entire flow field, the permeance data was used to compute the radii of curvature of the menisci separating the liquid condensate from the vapor.nIn the present work, the radius of curvature of the meniscus within the membrane is assumed to be known and kept fixed. From that, the expected permeance is computed employing three different descriptions. These are (i) a well known isothermal description, as also used by Petukhov et al. (2016), and two non-isothermal descriptions for which the energy balance is taken into account and (ii) an adiabatic or (iii) a diabatic boundary condition is applied at the downstream front of the membrane. These two latter descriptions correspond to no heat flux or arbitrarily large heat flux from downstreams to the downstream front of the membrane, respectively.nThe predicted permeances depend significantly on the chosen description. A comparison with experimental data indicates that a description with heat flux towards the downstream front of the membrane could agree best with data. However, the conclusion is that a determination of the radius of curvature of the meniscus within the membrane from permeance data alone is uncertain. Accurate temperature measurements at the upstream and downstream fronts of the membrane would increase the reliability of the determination of the radius of curvature of the meniscus within the membrane.n",20402.0,"Loimer, T.:Setničková, Kateřina:Uchytil, Petr",Separation and Purification Technology,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Selected opportunities for access to geriatric clients from the perspective of assisting professions,"Aim: The aim of the work was to find out what the influence of ICT use also on ICT (information and communication technology, in this case gaming console with motion sensor, which senses movements of the probanda body and thus is controlled by a fictional figure in the game) in the rehabilitation of cognitive functions on attention and orientation. Concept/methods: Alzheimer&apos,s disease is becoming increasingly the source of both professional and lay discourse. Statistical data show that increasing the average life expectancy increases the number of seniors and thus increases the number of people with dementia, with Alzheimer&apos,s disease being the most common type (up to 65% of all cases of dementia in the Czech Republic). This trend will continue to follow, and the number of people affected will increase. For guidance in 2006, 2231 people with Alzheimer&apos,s disease were registered, while in 2010 this number increased to 3148. For the research, 10 probands (100% of women) were used in the age range of 65-81 years, with the diagnosis of Alzheimer&apos,s disease - a light type. Probandi was divided into 5 groups, divided into 5 groups, into an experimental group that actively participated in the intervention and services provided by the institutions in which they were located, and a control group that participated only in the services and activities provided by institution.

Attempts by MNCs to Expand the Creative and Innovative Spirit through the Concept of Agility: Role of Global Managers,"Faced with an environment that is changing faster and faster, companies have long sought to encourage the almost automatic emergence of new approaches that can respond or even anticipate these changes. The development of creativity has become an essential theme. For more than 20 years, companies have been promoting the concept of agility at the same time as they attempted to extend creativity to all employees. Managers have been called upon to implement the corresponding actions. Our research, based on semi-structured interviews with 35 global managers, analyses several aspects of the implementation of the concepts. We looked particularly at what managers think of agility, how this concept relates to the efforts made to develop creativity, what they experienced, and the conditions for success. The analysis of the responses highlights the significant differences in perception, often linked to the functions performed in the company or to nationalities. Regardless of the value associated with agility, the interviewees agreed on the importance of the manager’s role while directing it in three different directions. The discussions also identify a series of necessary, but not sufficient conditions for creativity to emerge. Implications for Central European audience: This paper does not deal with a problem specific to Central Europe. It is a general problem going beyond regional limits, as international management tends to use the same concepts everywhere. However, in its processing, we sought to interview several managers from this geographic area. In the second phase, we plan to improve the representativeness of managers from Central Europe to understand better what is specific to them.",50204.0,"Montenero, Vincent Blaise:Cazorzi, C.",Central European Business Review,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Prague Linguistic Circle and Dialectics,"The study deals with dialectics in the context of the Prague Linguistic Circle, particularly in the context of Jan Mukařovský’s thinking. The essay presents 1) main sources of Mukařovský’s dialectics, and outlines 2) Mukařovský’s dialectical method. The notion of dialectics appears in Mukařovský’s scholarly work in a set of connections. He applied dialectics as a method, manner or form of rationality. It served as a means of gaining knowledge about the world, specific phenomena and objects, their essence, interconnectedness as well as development. Mukařovský also used it as a procedure for resolving contradictions (antinomies) that he encountered in his scientific explorations and in ordinary practical activities. He understood dialectical thinking as dynamic, open, and pluralist thinking striving to reflect reality as a constant process. Gradual coming together of dialectics and materialism, evident in Mukařovský’s scholarly works from mid-1930s, resulted, ten years later, in a public adoption of dialectical materialism.",60204.0,"Sládek, Ondřej",Enthymema,5,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very high speed train transmission,"High-speed train transmission is designed as single-stage conception and is developed for connection to the powertrain. On the input side, the transmission is connected to the motor via a gear coupling. The output shaft also represents the axis of the driven wheels. The gearbox is mounted on the input shaft side to the buggy by means of a reaction rod where the safety element is also located for case of its damage. Due to the location of the gearbox, the concept is supplemented with protective covers protecting the gearbox housing from damage from, for example, flying stones. Helical gears with modified tooth microgeometry are used in the gearbox to achieve a low transmission error value. Sufficient lubrication of the gears is ensured by wiping the output wheel in oil. At the same time, it is sprayed in the gearbox and trapped in the designed oil pockets, from which the channels are subsequently transported to the bearings.",,"Prokop, Aleš:Krpalek, David:Řehák, Kamil:Píštěk, Václav",,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sample activities presented in this text should demonstrate various possibilities to include three dimensional artworks into language classes. Furthermore, it is argued that it is worth experimenting with creative tasks, with less traditional sculptural art and with teaching outdoors. The statues and sculptures related to historical events or cultural controversies can provoke students to express their personal views and share their ideas, debating expectations and roles related to art in public spaces develops students´ critical thinking and cultural awareness.

Not only the chosen solution influences the cleaning efficiency, but also parameters as time, bath temperature and ultrasound frequency. The cleaning process was evaluated according to the volume of removed dirt and by observing wettability change using the measuring of contact angle of a water drop.

Labour law deals with not only rights and duties of parties involved in the execution of dependent work, but also with related legal relationships. If work performed by a natural person for another natural or legal person bears signs of dependent work, it must be performed within a labour law relationship. A key principle of labour law is the principle that ""everything which is not forbidden is allowed."" Labour law is traditionally divided into two parts, individual and collective labour law. Social security law is closely related to labour law, sometimes they constitute one unit (social law). Social law provides security related to health and social obstacles that prevent work execution. Social law is a joint term for both legal branches and is also the subject of education at certain German and Austrian universities.

To face these challenges, conservation agriculture (CA), which is based on minimal soil disturbance, mulching of crop residues, and crop rotation, has been promoted as an ecosystem approach to sustainable agriculture. Using social network analysis (SNA) methods, we analyzed the adoption patterns of CA practices among 222 maize smallholder farmers in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Our findings suggest that, in the process of adopting CA practices, farmers make interrelated decisions based on network and individual attributes, rather than accepting top-down transfers, as usually promoted by institutions. The role of extension agents and other farmers is crucial for innovation dissemination, given that farmers learn different practices from different sources. This points to the need to strengthen participatory methods and promote sustainability in agriculture, rather than a",40101.0,"Aguirre-López, Juan Manuel:Díaz-José, Julio:Chaloupková, Petra:Guevara-Hernández, Francisco",Challenges in Social Network Research,5,medium,medium,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Stress-strain assessment of dents in wall of high pressure gas pipeline,"The aim of this work was experimental study of the dents effect on structural integrity of a high-pressure gas pipeline with nominal diameter 300 mm after long-terme operation. Stress-strain behaviour of two dents was evaluated by strain gauge chains oriented in hoop direction. Dent profiles were measured by digital slide caliper in circumferential and longitudinal direction in points distant 10 mm from each other. Residual deformations were detected after internal pressure loading by water to the operating level. Negative and positive values of residual deformation were found wuth the help of strain gauges. Fatigue resistance was tested by 10 000 pressures cycles with load asymmetry R = 0 and maximum internal pressure p(max) = 6,3 MPa (nominal operating level). Internal pressure cyclic loading caused an increase of residual deformation values. By means of subsequent pressure burst test, the limit state of this type defect was found. Two dwells were realized in 66% and 100% yield stress. Negative values of strain were observed at strain gauges placed on edge of dents. Positive values of strain were found at strain gauges placed inside the dents. The increase of internal pressure led to the changes of dent shape. Dent depth decreased and the original circular tube profile was reached again. The pipe fracture occurred at the internal pressure of 19 MPa. Tensile properties and Charpy absorbed energy were measured on standartized specimens of the pipe material. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Method of Optimizing the Concrete Reinforcement Arrangement and Orientation in Concrete,"According to the new method of optimizing the concrete reinforcement arrangement and orientation in concrete, the load imposed on the building element to be manufactured with defined dimensions is calculated using common methods and based on this known load, the distribution of tensile stress in this building element is determined. The tensile stress distribution in the given building element is determined by creating a computer geometric model of this building element. The volume of the geometric model of the building element is then split by a spatial mesh system into small discrete volumes from the group of shapes cube, cuboid, pyramid. The shape of a discrete volume is selected based on the shape of the building element and the size is selected based on the requested fineness of the resulting spatial reinforcement mesh. Then, the magnitudes of tensile stresses and spatial vectors of their directions at individual discrete nodes of the mesh are determined. Based on data obtained as described above, are designed both the directions of reinforcements in individual discrete nodes given by the resulting direction of the tensile stress, and also the diameters of individual reinforcement bars corresponding to the magnitudes of these tensile stresses. The resulting spatial reinforcement mesh is modeled by means of a CAD software and printed out using the Direct Metal Laser Sintering 3D metal printing method. The produced spatial reinforcement mesh is inserted into the formwork, concrete is poured in, and when it hardens, the final building element is demoulded. The magnitudes of tensile stresses and their directions at the individual discrete nodes of the mesh are determined for example by the finite element method, the boundary element method, or the finite difference method. ### The patent is exploited by its owner.",,"Kolísko, Jiří:Tej, Petr",,5,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Trend, Development, Role and Importance of Corporate Taxes in the EU","Monograph ""Trend, Development, Role and Importance of Corporate Taxes in the EU"" deals with corporate tax which is relatively young tax levy (it was first introduced in its current form in 1898 in Germany) to which there is strong controversy and which is also used as an instrument of economic policy. The publication is divided into four chapters and follows the theoretical-application line. The first chapter classifies corporate tax to the tax system, defines its place in the market economy and classifies corporate tax into different tax classifications with regard to various criteria. The second chapter presents corporate tax in detail as a direct income tax and refers to its mechanism, principles and characteristics. Since a corporation is not an individual, it is clear that the tax burden will always be shifted either to the owners of the companies, its employees or it will be reflected in the product prices. The main and the largest part of the book - the third chapter - describes the development of corporate taxes in the countries of the current European Union. The chapter illustrates the complex development of coordination and harmonization of corporate taxes from initial consideration about the ease of this process to the realization that the Member States have no interest in harmonization. The text of this chapter is illustrated by extracts of the fundamental directives of corporate taxation, significant judgments of the Court of Justice of the EU and suggestions of the future direction of coordination of corporate taxes (deepening of providing information, CCCTB project). The text of the chapter contains a comprehensive description of the corporate tax system in each EU country in the order in which countries acceded to the EEC, resp. EC, resp. EU.

Management approach to motivation of white-collar employees in forest enterprises,"Employee motivation is a prerequisite for the effective development of the potential of human resources. Therefore, motivation processes are important. The aim of the paper was to define the motivational priorities of white-collar employees in forest enterprises. Following the research results, cluster analysis statistical methods were used to define employee groups with similar motivations. The research was carried out in 11 forest enterprises with 195 total respondents. The results indicated that it is possible to create a unified motivation program with selected motivation factors for white-collar employees in forest enterprises. Defined groups had similar levels of motivation in individual motivation factors. Three significant motivation factors were determined: basic salary, working environment, and fair appraisal system. These motivation factors can be systematically implemented as a tool to improve the level of motivation of individual groups.

Finite element analysis of 6 large PMMA skull reconstructions: A multi-criteria evaluation approach,"In this study 6 pre-operative designs for PMMA based reconstructions of cranial defects were evaluated for their mechanical robustness using finite element modeling. Clinical experience and engineering principles were employed to create multiple plan options, which were subsequently computationally analyzed for mechanically relevant parameters under 50N loads: stress, strain and deformation in various components of the assembly. The factors assessed were: defect size, location and shape. The major variable in the cranioplasty assembly design was the arrangement of the fixation plates. An additional study variable introduced was the location of the 50N load within the implant area. It was found that in smaller defects, it was simpler to design a symmetric distribution of plates and under limited variability in load location it was possible to design an optimal for expected loads. However, for very large defects with complex shapes, the variability in the load locations introduces complications to the intuitive design of the optimal assembly. The study shows that it can be beneficial to incorporate multi design computational analyses to decide upon the most optimal plan for a clinical case.",10700.0,"Borák, Libor:Marcián, Petr:Wolff, Jan:Narra, Nathaniel:Forouzanfar, Tim:Ridwan-Pramana, Angela",PLOS ONE,5,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Solar radiation as the likely cause of acid-soluble rare-earth elements in sediments of fresh water humic lakes,"We studied photochemically induced precipitation of rare-earth elements (REEs) in water from a tributary to Plegne Lake and a tributary to Jiricka Pond, Czech Republic. Both tributaries had high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (similar to 1.8 mmol C L-1). Filtered (0.2 mu m) samples were exposed to artificial solar radiation of 350 W m(-2) for 48 to 96 h, corresponding to 3 to 6 days of natural solar radiation in summer at the sampling locations. Experiments were performed with altered and unaltered pH ranging from 3.8 to 6.0. The formation of particulate REEs occurred in all exposed samples with the fastest formation observed at the original pH. The formation of particulate metals continued in irradiated samples after the end of irradiation, suggesting that photochemically induced reactions and/or continuing precipitation continue in darkness or in deeper water due to mixing. Results were compared with paleolimnological records in the Plesne Lake sediment. At pH 5.0, the photochemically induced sediment flux was 3509 nmol m(-2) y(-1) for Ce, corresponding to 42% of the REEs' annual sediment flux in recent sediment layers. Combining the formation rates obtained in the laboratory irradiation experiments and known 1 day incident solar radiation enabled the estimation of a possible REE sediment flux. For Plesne Lake, the photochemically induced formation of particulate REEs explained 10-44% of the REE concentrations in the upper sediment layers. Observed photochemically induced sequestration of REEs into sediments can explain a significant part of the REEs' history in the Holocene sediment.",10511.0,"Porcal, Petr:Amirbahman, A.:Kopáček, Jiří:Norton, S.

Mechanical properties and high-cycle fatigue strength of 3d printed inconel 718 alloy and effects of high- temperature exposure to corrosive atmosphere,"3D printing is an advanced technology of manufacturing engineering components of complicated parts with a large market potential. This technology is particularly promising due to its potential possibilities of rapid manufacturing of components to their final shape and dimensions, which would significantly reduce production costs particularly due to reduction of production time and labour demands. This paper deals with results of an experimental programme aimed at investigation of selected properties of an Inconel 718 alloy manufactured using direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) method. The material is to be potentially used for manufacture of turbine blades for energy applications. Therefore, there are very high requests for mechanical properties and fatigue resistance at different conditions, which have to be investigated and demonstrated. It was shown that mechanical properties were quite strongly oriented considering the printing direction. In general, static mechanical properties were better than those of the material manufactured by conventional methods. Hardness and course of hardness did not significantly depend, as expected, on printing direction. In addition, hardness was higher in the material exposed to high temperature corrosive atmosphere. Reasons are discussed. Concerning high-cycle fatigue resistance, this characteristics was dependent on the printing direction. Fatigue strength of printed samples was higher than that of conventionally manufactured material in some cases. Damage mechanisms were investigated and they are discussed.",20501.0,"Černý, Ivo:Kec, Jan:Poloch, Adam",AIP Conference Proceedings,5,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Microstructure Evaluation of Heterogeneous Electron Beam Weld between Stabilised Austenitic and ODS Ferritic Steel,"The weldability of advanced heat resistant ODS metallic materials in combination with conventional materials is a prior requirement for their wider use in energy production. The microstructure of ODS steels is composed of alpha iron based matrix with dispersed oxide particles. Due to heating during conventional welding, the microstructure and properties of the resulting weld joints are affected and the joints often become the weakest point of the structure. The electron beam welding with its reduced heat affected zone size may be an answer in this. The presented article is focused on thorough metallographic evaluation of the structure of heterogeneous electron beam welds which combine stabilized austenitic stainless steel with the MA956 ferritic ODS steel. EB welded joints were evaluated by light and analytical electron microscopy including EDS and phase EBSD analyses in the as-welded state and after post-weld heat treatment. Mechanical properties of the weld were evaluated from the results of micro hardness profiles. Achieving an appropriate structure of such welds and correct welding parameters are crucial aspects for future successful application of similar joints in energy industry",20502.0,"Jan, Vít:Čupera, Jan:Šohaj, Pavel:Havlík, Petr",Materials Science Forum,5,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Paradoxes of financial schemes for resilient flood recovery of households,"Flood resilience (resilient flood risk management), which has been repeatedly demanded, can be achieved through the phases of the risk management cycle. There is a vast body of literature on adaptation, disaster risk reduction measures, and effectiveness of prevention, seen through the lens of postdisaster recovery, but oftentimes the existing literature seems to underestimate the impact of financial flood recovery schemes on resilient recovery of individual households in particular. This contribution focuses on how financial schemes for flood damage compensations-their sources, design, and timing-shape the resilience of recovery of individual households. It discusses the dilemma of recovery of whether recovery schemes should be used strategically to increase resilience, or rather serve early restoration needs, equality access issues, and so on.

Pavel Haas : Janacek's Most Gifted Pupil?,"In the course of the 1920s and 30s Pavel Haas (1899-1944) earned a reputation for himself in broader cultural consciousness as an original composer and Janáček's ""most talented student"". Yet Janáček’s influence would only fully manifest itself at the moment when, striving to find his own creative methods, he distanced himself from his teacher. Haas was a composer who to an extent greater than that of Janáček’s other pupils responded to the stimuli arriving in Czech music from outside, primarily those of the French modernists. By his embracing the tendencies that would in the future affect the development of modern music, he resembles a few other Czech composers of note (Martinů, for instance). Yet these partial syntheses notwithstanding, Haas did not craft a truly singular style of his own. Another essential trait of Haas is that he made only a rather marginal contribution to the future evolution of Czech music.

The paper presents qualitative evaluation of 10 existing centres, based on standardized interviews with coworking centres providers. Variety of services and different location in the region opens the space for cooperation support. The objective of the study was to analyse and contrast main services offered by each centre in relationship to networking potential and development of services for cross-border cooperation. Value added of the paper could be se en in original suggestions of cooperation between centres in different forms of networking in a form of cross-border cooperation in the Czech-Polish area.",50204.0,"ŠEBESTOVÁ, Jarmila:ŠPERKA, Roman:Małecka, Joanna:Łuczka, Teresa",Forum Scientiae Oeconomia,5,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Increasing Efficient Partnership amog Organizations,"To increase effective partnership among organizations (e.g. university, company) communication and education are important (transfer and exchange of experience). These have positive influence on the efficient operation among organizations. The transfer of experience works in a form of seminars or workshops. Education is in a form of tuition, training or exercising, for example, crisis management staff. All that mentioned is ensured by activating activities among organizations in certain areas (e.g. safety). The interconnecting element is creativity of solved problems using simulation and response to the current situation and needs.

Introduction to Electromagnetic Compatibility for Electronic Engineers … and not only for them,"During his academic and engineering experience in the field of electronics and electromagnetic compatibility, the author of this book has encountered similar and frequently recurring problems, as well as questions from students and circuit designers. Therefore he decided to prepare this brief text as a guide for those interested in electromagnetic compatibility, covering the issues from the design of electronic devices up to their certification in accordance with laws. The aim was to explain the most important principles without exhaustive definitions, but without prejudice to the correctness of the interpretation at the same time. The interpretation of the issues is complemented by personal experience of the author obtained in the field of EMC measurements. Inside this book, the reader will find a very brief introduction to the theory of electromagnetic field, which is necessary to understand the main EMC issues. Subsequently, there is a chapter devoted to general description of the EMC issues. The author’s aim consisted in an attempt to provide such description that can be understood by specialists who do not make their livings by designing electronic circuits as such. This includes, for example, project managers, technical science teachers, technical business representatives et cetera. This general information is followed by another non-technical part that provides a description on general law requirements concerning the electromagnetic compatibility. This issue cannot be omitted as applicable laws in every country in the world require the electronic devices to fulfil minimum requirements on their interference limits, safety of operation and reliability. Afterwards the “technician’s area” begins. The next chapter provide description on the instrumentation applied in EMC laboratories and the most frequent tests.

Tissue clearing and its applications in neuroscience,"State-of-the-art tissue-clearing methods provide subcellular-level optical access to intact tissues from individual organs and even to some entire mammals. When combined with light-sheet microscopy and automated approaches to image analysis, existing tissue-clearing methods can speed up and may reduce the cost of conventional histology by several orders of magnitude. In addition, tissue-clearing chemistry allows whole-organ antibody labelling, which can be applied even to thick human tissues. By combining the most powerful labelling, clearing, imaging and data-analysis tools, scientists are extracting structural and functional cellular and subcellular information on complex mammalian bodies and large human specimens at an accelerated pace. The rapid generation of terabyte-scale imaging data furthermore creates a high demand for efficient computational approaches that tackle challenges in large-scale data analysis and management. In this Review, we discuss how tissue-clearing methods could provide an unbiased, system-level view of mammalian bodies and human specimens and discuss future opportunities for the use of these methods in human neuroscience.

Effect of Sigma Phase on Fracture Behavior of Steels and Weld Joints of Components in Power Industry Working at Supercritical Conditions,"Chapter deal with the change of the structure and mechanical properties of the austenitic steels after the exposure at temperatures corresponding to the ultra-super critical (USC) and advanced ultra-super critical (A-USC) parameters. The grades TP347HFG, Super 304H and HR3C were chosen in the study as well as their welded joints. Several bend radii corresponding to various amount of plastic deformation were investigated in order to understand relation between cold work plastic deformation, mechanical properties including creep and the structural changes with the special attention to the generation of sigma phase during long-term high temperature exposure. The effect of solution annealing made after cold work on the material properties and structural changes was studied, too. The mechanical properties were studied using small punch test (SPT) and miniaturized tensile tests taken both from straight part and extrados of bends under investigation. Creep properties of either base metal either welded joints were tested and evaluated using standard creep specimens at temperatures 650, 700 and 750 °C. The obtained results confirmed that the mechanical properties and the structure were significantly influenced by the one-year exposure at the working temperature. The presence of σ-phase was confirmed in the extrados part of the tube bends even after thermal exposure without any loading. On the contrary, no sigma phase was identified in the welds and straight parts of tubes. Very positive effect of solution annealing on the retardation of sigma phase precipitation was found, although in the extrados of bent tubes the same heat treatment caused grain coarsening in the regions affected by welding. The results of experiments were compared with other results obtained from analyses of tubes after 100,000 hours of exposure in a USC block where extensive precipitation of sigma phase was also identified. From experimental data, it can be concluded that even small amount of sigma phase causes drop in fracture properties of all steels under investigation.",20502.0,"Kuboň, Zdeněk:Kander, Ladislav:Stejskalová, Šárka",Austenitic Stainless Steels - New Aspects,5,medium,high,1,1,high,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

Biomarkers of deoxynivalenol (DON) and its modified form DON-3-glucoside (DON-3G) in humans,"Background: To date, considerable research has been devoted to biomarkers of deoxynivalenol (DON) and its modified form DON-3-glucoside (DON-3G) in humans. Since these both cause toxic effects in humans, identifying the biomarkers of these toxins is crucial for human health. Scope and approach: In the present review, we systematically assess the profiles of human DON biomarkers in different regions, ages, sexes, and dietary habits, the specific features of DON biomarkers in pregnant women are discussed separately. We highlight recent advances in our knowledge of human DON-3G biomarkers. Key findings and conclusions: Free DON and DON-glucuronide (DON-GlcA) are the major biomarkers of DON in human urine, whereas DON-3-sulphate and the deepoxy product DOM-1 are the secondary biomarkers. The amount of DON exposure in children and adolescents is higher than that in adults, whereas the elderly show the lowest levels, suggesting that young people, including children, face greater health risks from this toxin. DON can cross the placental barrier from mothers and may inhibit foetal growth and immune function. The vegetarian population shows a higher risk of exposure to DON and DON-3G due to their greater consumption of vegetables and cereals. Animal studies show that females excrete DON and its principal metabolites, including DON-3-GlcA, in their urine more rapidly than males. DON-15-GlcA is the most prominent urinary biomarker of DON-3G. This review should help to further understanding the specific profiles of human DON and DON-3G biomarkers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",21101.0,"Deng, Y.:You, L.:Nepovimová, Eugenie:Wang, X.:Musílek, Kamil:Wu, Qinghua:Wu, Wenda:Kuča, Kamil",Trends in Food Science and Technology,5,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Czech Republic,"The intellectual property law that is valid and applicable in the territory of the Czech Republic has sources from three legal systems—international, EU, and national. Therefore, the holder of intellectual property rights enjoying protection in the Czech Republic disposes with a set of claims and instruments defending his brands on the Czech market, regardless whether the context is of online and/or offline distribution and/or after-sales service. These rights, as well as claims and instruments defending them, are rather standard and harmonized with the intellectual property law and intellectual property law features prevailing in the EU. Nevertheless, the question of striking a fair balance between such holders of intellectual property rights and consumers are nationally particular, and so, even in the case of the Czech Republic, national special priorities and rules can be identified.

'Eurocentrism inside Europe': Eurocentric Progressivism in Historiography of the Eighteenth Century Habsburg Monarchy and Russian Tsardom,"This chapter analyzes progressive narratives in the English language on the eighteenth century Habsburg Monarchy and Russian Tsardom. There are two reasons for discussing these Eurocentric narratives: First, the most distinctive characteristic of Eurocentric historiography is its interpretation of reforms in the material conditions of societies as the primary indicator of success or progress. Many Western scholars of the Habsburg and Russian Empires stress the institutional reforms of central governments and depict both states as historically successful enterprises, so long as the reforms produced new outcomes, regardless of the actual social and cultural circumstances surrounding those reforms. The result is, more than often, progressive narratives. In reality, to what extent these two historical entities may be regarded as historically successful enterprises is arguable. This argument will be substantiated with examples from within the scholarship. Second, despite the fact that much of the Habsburg and Russian historical geography was natural elements of European history, the two states did not operate in a completely European historical framework. Therefore, we should approach early modern Habsburg and Russian states as peculiar political entities which possessed idiosyncratic social and cultural characteristics will bring us closer to understanding the.",0.0,"Yılmaz, Yasir","Eurocentrism at the Margins: Encounters, Critics and Going Beyond",5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Reformation, Counter-Reformation, and Baroque in  European Literatures of the West and the East","The author of the present study deals with he whole complex of religious, cultural and artistic phenomena linked with the rise of the European Reformation with special regard to the situation of Central and Eastern Europe and in the Slavonic literary world. He tried to demonstrate that there are some pre-reformation streams which came into existence in the period of Hussite wars and had a very differentiated shape and structure. The roots of the Reformation process in its initial and ideological substance are intereresting as typical phenomena of Central European social and religious thought inspired by various currents, often of Eastern origin, connected with buddhism, manicheism and zoroastrianism. Though the Reformation is sometimes understood as a phenomenon leading to disintegration of hitherto existing universal structures of European thought, it, on the contrary, led to a new attempt at the restoration and renovation of former unity of thought forming one cultural and artistic whole. In the centre of his interpretation there are Petr Chelčický as an inspirer of the Czech/Moravian Brethren, Comenius as a bishop of this first non-Catholic Christian Church in the world some 200 years later and his pansophy as an attempt at the synthesis and universal view coming into existence under the impact of the tragedies of European religious clashes and wars also reflected in his artistic creations.

Complex biofuels related scenarios generated by qualitative reasoning under severe information shortages: A review,"There is a broad spectrum of BR (Biofuel Related) models. However the models are highly specific. Such models cannot flexibly support complex decision making activities to identify feasible trade-offs among many objective functions. They represent just one point of view, e.g. engineering, company economics. Therefore CBRMs (Complex Biofuel Related Model) are studied in this paper. CBRMs must cover additional aspects, e.g. macroeconomic, ecology, sociology and politics. Such models are inevitably unique, partially subjective, inconsistent, vague and multidimensional. AI (Artificial Intelligence) has developed a number of tools to solve such problems. Qualitative reasoning is one of them. It is based on the least information intensive quantifiers i.e. trends. There are just three trend / qualitative values: plus/increasing, zero/constant, negative/decreasing. There are many CBRM items related to soft aspects e.g. politics, taxation etc. which cannot be quantified by numbers. They are too vague. For example – if the political/sociological sensitivity of land ownership is increasing then the cost of biofuels is increasing. Such verbal knowledge item cannot be incorporated into a traditional numerical model. The paper describes developments of CBRMs based on expert knowledge and common sense. A consensus among experts is often not reached because of substantial subjectivity of experts’ knowledge. A qualitative intersection of CBRMs developed by several experts is simple. The case study presents a model based on integration of 10 heuristics using 9 variables e.g. Refinery Capacity, Cost of Biofuel Production, and Biofuel Demand. The result is represented by 13 scenarios. The paper is self-contained, no a prior knowledge of qualitative models is required.",50602.0,"Dohnal, Mirko",RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS,5,high,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
The timing of salt structure growth in the Southern Permian Basin (Central Europe) and implications for basin dynamics,"In this paper, a literature-based compilation of the timing and history of salt tectonics in the Southern Permian Basin (Central Europe) is presented. The tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the Southern Permian Basin is influenced by salt movement and the structural development of various types of salt structures. The compilation presented here was used to characterize the following syndepositional growth stages of the salt structures: (a) “phase of initiation”, (b) phase of fastest growth (“main activity”), and (c) phase of burial. We have also mapped the spatial pattern of potential mechanisms that triggered the initiation of salt structures over the area studied and summarized them for distinct regions (sub-basins, platforms, etc.). The data base compiled and the set of maps produced from it provide a detailed overview of the spatial and temporal distribution of salt tectonic activity enabling the correlation of tectonic phases between specific regions of the entire Southern Permian Basin. Accordingly, salt movements were initiated in deeply subsided graben structures and fault zones during the Early and Middle Triassic. In these areas, salt structures reached their phase of main activity already during the Late Triassic or the Jurassic and were mostly buried during the Early Cretaceous. Salt structures in less subsided sub-basins and platform regions of the Southern Permian Basin mostly started to grow during the Late Triassic. The subsequent phase of main activity of these salt structures took place from the Late Cretaceous to the Cenozoic. The analysis of the trigger mechanisms revealed that most salt structures were initiated by large-offset normal faults in the sub-salt basement in the large graben structures and minor normal faulting associated with thin-skinned extension in the less subsided basin parts.",10505.0,"Warsitzka, Michael:Jähne-Klingberg, F.:Kley, J.:Kukowski, N.",Basin Research,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Challenges of Teaching Gender in Translation in the Czech Contemporary Context,"The contribution addresses the limits of teaching the translation of feminist discourse written in English (a notion that I use for both literary and non-literary texts) into Czech. One of the major limits is the fact that the Czech culture (because of the 40 years of state socialism between 1948-1989) has not experienced a modern feminist movement in the 2nd half of the 20th century, or in the opening decades of the 21st. Therefore the receptivity of the Czech &quot,target&quot, culture towards feminist and gender-minded discourse is minimal. This has been reflected in the Czech language and cultural norms (i.e. prevalent trends) up to the present. The &quot,target&quot, norms are, however, espoused as crucial by some translation theories informing teaching and practice, they affect editorial and publishing policies as well as the politics of identity of translators. Within this explained context, the contribution explains the teaching strategies that the author has used to contradict the Czech culturally conditioned gender insensitivity in both her optional courses (&quot,Gender in Translation&quot,), which attract students interested in feminism, and regular courses in the Translation Studies programmes in Prague, in which students may be ignorant of feminism, indifferent or even hostile to it.",60203.0,"Kalivodová, Eva",Traducir para la igualdad sexual = Translating for sexual equality,5,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ameloblastoma pathogenesis: WNT signaling and associated cell adhesion molecules,"Ameloblastoma is the most common odontogenic tumor in humans. It is usually benign but can in some cases invade local structures including bones. Recurrence following surgical treatment is very common. Here, we investigated the role of WNT signaling pathway in pathogenesis of ameloblastoma with focus on Frizzled6 (FZD6), one of receptors playing a role in determining the planar cell polarity and WNT related cell-cell adhesion molecules. In human embryos, strong expression of WNT receptor FZD6 was found in the dental lamina and epithelial dental remnants, which are known to contribute to ameloblastoma initiation. Comparison to ameloblastoma tissues revealed a distinct expression pattern of FZD6 in its benign and malignant forms with a robust expression in the central areas of the epithelial islets. To analyze differences in the expression of genes encoding canonical and non-canonical WNT pathway members, we performed a detailed PCR array analysis on healthy gingivae, benign and malignant form of ameloblastomas. Compared to healthy gingivae, the most downregulated WNT ligands in ameloblastoma were WNT4, WNT6, and WNT8a. Some distinct differences between the malignant and benign form were also observed, including downregulation of the WNT7b expression in the malignant tissue. Moreover, downregulation of beta-catenin expression was accompanied by an altered expression of membrane proteins, moreover, beta-catenin associated adhesion molecules such as DSC2, DSP or JUP were downregulated in patient tissues. Instant response of cells on altered WNT signaling changes tested on primary cell cultures confirmed the effect of WNT inhibition on the downregulation of genes associated with cell adhesions. In conclusion, our study provided a deeper insight into the gene expression profile of WNT pathway members in the benign and malignant forms of ameloblastoma, opening up new avenues, which should be tested for potential prediction of future cell behavior in this neoplasm.",,"Putnová, Barbora:Hrubá, E.:Putnová, Iveta:Štembírek, J.:Hurník, P.:Paclíková, P.:Bryja, V.:Daněk, Z.:Catón, J.:Buchtová, M.",,5,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Impact assessment of Proposal for a Directive on the limitation of emissions from medium combustion plants - National impact assessment compared to the European impact estimate,"The December 2013 Medium Combustion Plants Directive (MCP Directive) proposal was evaluated by the national governments. In the Czech Republic, there are 6710 plants affected by this Directive, which is about 4.6% of the total of 143,000 relevant European plants. The paper introduces our approach of policy impact assessment called SimTool. The costs estimated for the European Commission in the background study (AMEC, 2014) are assumed to reach EUR 5.9 million for the Czech Republic for the preferred scenario by the European Commission. Further presented national impact assessment estimates the induced annual costs of the proposal at EUR 61 million, which is about 10 times greater than the European impact assessment estimate. As part of the national impact assessment, the different fuel categories had to be analyzed separately due to their specific features and different options for achieving the emission limit target values. During the impact assessment, a survey was made in order to determine the source operators&apos, preferences and responses to the potential adoption of the MCP Directive. Based on the analysis of data from the operators and consultations with experts about the different technologies, technical options for achievement of the proposed emission limits, including an estimate of the operating and investment costs, were proposed. The paper concentrates on the Czech impact assessment approach and discusses the reasons of the discrepancy between the European impact assessment and the Czech version. We argue that the inaccuracies of the European impact assessments are given by usage of the general abatement cost curves in the models which do not reflect the reality sufficiently. This paper states an argument for the necessity to carry out analysis at the local level.",50202.0,"Vojáček, Ondřej:Sobotka, Ladislav:Macháč, Jan:Žilka, Miroslav",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,5,medium,high,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE GLOBALIZED WORLD AND MIGRANTS: IMPACTS ON HEALTHCARE MARKETS,"The eminent impacts of migration we can also find in the healthcare sector.

Globalisation and migration are not the new concepts, but it gives more and more into the context of many issues, both at the level economic and social needs. And considering to the development of globalization trends, it is expected that this concept is being discussed more and more often. For key manager of the global economy, including the World Trade Organization, the migration of workers forms an integral and beneficial component of globalization and the liberalization of the service sector. On the other hand the International Labour Office and the International Organization for Migration, whilst recognizing the benefits of managed migration.

Utilization of Heat Accumulation in Control of Cyclic Systems,"Heat exchangers often have a form of systems with heat-transporting medium circulating in enclosed loop. Imperfect heat transfer leads to its return back to the heating unit in the form of disturbance. Such an input can negatively impact the precise temperature control. This chapter is dedicated to study problematic and possibilities of integrating this phenomenon to a more effective temperature regulation. From the viewpoint of process control we do not only address the way how the input signal affects the system, but also how the system itself affects input signals. The study of the issue consequently offers a mathematical description of a system extended with elements representing the returning heat.

Modelling of impact behaviour of European beech subjected to split Hopkinson pressure bar test,"The hardwood, as a natural composite, may be subjected to the dynamic loading in many applications, such as the high-speed disintegration or structural collapses. The correct material description is needed for finite element modelling that can take place in the design stages of wood manufacturing processes or building the wooden structures. The split Hopkinson pressure (Kolsky) bar test provides the data for high strain rates. The experiments were carried out on the European beech wood in all the principal loading directions. The tests were repeated computationally in order to obtain the material constants of the complex material model, which covered the anisotropy of elasticity, plasticity as well as fracture behaviour. Moreover, the failure was considered non-symmetric with respect to the tension and compression. This was achieved by incorporating the stress triaxiality dependency into the failure model.

Historical Memory of Central and East European Communism,"Every political movement creates its own historical memory. The communist movement, though originally oriented toward the future, was no exception: The theory of human history constitutes a substantial part of Marx’s and Engels’s writings, and the movement inspired by them very soon developed its own strong historical identity, combining the Marxist theory of history with the movement’s victorious milestones such as the October Revolution and later the Great Patriotic War, which served as communist legitimization myths throughout almost the entire twentieth century. During the Stalinist period, however, the movement’s history became strongly reinterpreted to suit Stalin’s political goals. After 1956, this reinterpretation lost most of its legitimating power and instead began to be a burden. The (unwanted) memory of Stalinism and subsequent examples of violence (the Gulag, Katyn, the 1956 Budapest uprising and the 1968 Prague Spring) contributed to the crisis of Eastern European state socialism in the late 1980s and led to attempts at reformulating or even rejecting communist self-identity. This book’s fi rst section analyzes the post-1989 memory of communism and state socialism and the self-identity of the Eastern and Western European left. The second section examines the state socialist and post-socialist memorial landscapes in the former German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia/ Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine and Russia.

Typology of 18-Year-Old Czech Grammar School Students by their Addiction to Computer Games,"The aim of the paper is to interpret the preliminary results of a research study focused on addictive behaviour regarding computer games in 18-year-old Czech grammar school students. In the research we used a quantitative research strategy with an own questionnaire to identify the degree of addictive behaviour in students in relation to computer games. The research sample consisted of 486 students in grade three of four-year grammar schools (or an equivalent grade of multi-year grammar schools) from 9 randomly selected schools. The first part of the research focused on an analysis of questionnaire items relating to a broader approach to addictive student behaviour, which resulted in defining two basic groups of grammar school students. These groups are of about the same size but have different characteristics. The second part of the research focused on an analysis of scaled questionnaire items relating to the symptoms of addictive student behaviour. It was revealed that Czech grammar school students can be divided into four typical groups (clusters) according to the degree of addictive behaviour. The group with the highest degree of addictive behaviour (cluster 3) included 8.25 % of all grammar school students, while the group with almost no signs of addiction (cluster 2) had 32.58 % of students. The research study also considered other typical characteristics of the defined groups of students such as gender (dominance of males in cluster 3, dominance of females in cluster 2), preferred leisure activities (playing PC games in cluster 3) or the average time of playing computer games during a single day (187 minutes in cluster 3 as opposed to 35 minutes in cluster 2).

Verification of Strain Gauge and Geodetic Measurements during Long-term Monitoring of Gagarin Bridge in Working Conditions,"The paper deals with issues of measurement use to assess behavior of structures. The integrated approach of using the strain gauge and geodetic methods enables to verify both methods and evaluate temperature dependencies of structures. Nowadays, the strain gauge and geodetic measurements are used separately. However, integration of both methods contributes to find real behavior of structures. Utilization of knowledge of measurement integration can be applied for example during long term monitoring of structures or during static load test measurements. The actual measured values of deflections and structure’s deformations are mainly influenced by ambient temperature, variable temperature of the structure and by other external conditions. It is necessary to determine clear values of deflection and deformation without influence of external conditions to correctly evaluate behavior of a structure. Geodetic methods determine absolute changes related to reference system, strain gauges determine relative changes within the structure with higher accuracy. Selected interesting results of verification of strain and geodetic measurements gained from long term monitoring of bridge called Gagarin (built in 1961) in working conditions are described in this article. The thermal field of the structure was measured by thermometers and thermal cameras. The aim of the research was to integrate both methods and use them effectively to design and assess structures in building practice – mainly structures with small deformations.",0.0,"Bureš, Jiří:Klusáček, Ladislav:Nečas, Radim:Fixel, Jiří",Applied System Innovation: Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Applied System Innovation (ICASI 2015),5,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Air Pollution Sources’ Contribution to PM2.5 Concentration in the Northeastern Part of the Czech Republic,"This article focuses on the source apportionment of air pollution in a specific northeastern part of the Czech Republic. The research area, located around the city of Třinec, is significantly affected by a complex spectrum of air pollution sources, including local residential heating (coal and wood burning), heavy industry (mainly iron and steel production), road traffic, and regional and long-range air pollution transport from the nearby cities, Poland, and other countries. The main pollution sources contributing to the total concentration of fine suspended particles (PM2.5) were evaluated on the basis of the measurements at three sites and on subsequent positive matrix factorization modeling. The six major air pollution factors were identified, and their relative and absolute contributions were quantified. The result of the study is that the most important current task of air protection is to reduce the residential emissions from solid fuels, which are responsible for approximately 50–60% of PM2.5 concentration, followed by the regional primary and secondary aerosol sources (up to 40% of the total PM2.5 aerosol mass). Lower contributions have been identified in the case of resuspended mineral and biogenic particles (15–20%), long-range (trans-European) air pollution transport (up to 10%), and heavy industry (up to 10% in the most affected location). A detailed discussion has been provided considering specific regional EC (elemental carbon)–OC (organic carbon) relations in the region with traditional coal-burning for household heating which complicate the interpretation of the PMF (Positive Matrix Factorization) results, especially due to the interference between the traffic, residential heating, and biogenic aerosol factors.",10511.0,"Hladký, Daniel:Krejčí, Blanka:Nikolová, Irina:Seibert, Radim:Volná, Vladimíra",Ambient Air Quality in the Czech Republic,5,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Evaluation of fatigue resistance of laser welded high pressure vessels steel P355 considering fracture mechanics approach,"Laser welding is an innovative technology of joining metallic materials. In comparison with conventional arc welding, it has numerous advantages, like high energy of laser beam and high effectiveness, very good reproducibility, possibilities of automation, low energy consumption etc. High pressure vessels and high pressure pipeline industry represent perspective new fields of application. However, since pressure vessels and pipelines are usually operated at conditions of repeated or cyclic loading, an acceptable resistance to fatigue loading of the welds has to be demonstrated. In this contribution, results of an experimental programme aimed at an evaluation of high-cycle fatigue resistance in and near laser welds of a P355 pressure vessel steel are presented and discussed. Particular attention is paid to evaluation of crack initiation mechanisms in connection to laser weld character and welding imperfections. The programme is completed by measurement of fatigue crack growth rates and threshold values in the weld. Results of high-cycle fatigue tests of some groups of specimens were characteristic by a considerable scatter. The reason of the scatter was found in welding defects in some parts of the welds. Fatigue results are discussed also from the viewpoint of fracture mechanics and threshold values of fatigue crack growth.",20501.0,"Černý, Ivo:Kec, Jan",Key Engineering Materials,5,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Optimization of Process Field Measurement GNSS-RTK for Railway Infrastructure,"The paper describes measurements in field on points of railway control by the GNSS-RTK method. In the model each of these points can be represented by node in graph and evaluation of graph edges corresponds to the distance between individual nodes. The task is to measure on every node even one times and to absolve the total route with minimal sum of distance. In fact it is searching of the Hamilton's path in a graph. The situation is complicated because the conditions for GNSS-RTK surveying in nodes are suitable only at certain time intervals during the day. Generally the above mentioned task is NP - completely problem, which is solved in the practice in many cases by heuristic methods.

Evaluation of Pilots’ Psychophysiological Condition using Recurrence Quantification Analysis of Heart Rate Variability,"Psychological discomfort or increased stress can negatively influence performing specific activities mainly concerning professions which are responsible for human lives. Such group of professionals includes aviation specialists, especially pilots. Psychophysiological state is indicated by certain physiological parameters by means of which it is possible to describe it. There is a wide range of methods for signal processing of measured physiological parameters which are, however, based on linear methods. This paper deals with application of non-linear method, the so-called recurrence quantification analysis for evaluation of psychophysiological state of pilots. For this purpose, R-R interval recording of pilots in training was conducted by the means of wearable telemetric system. Research sample consisted of 35 beginner pilots and measurements were performed during both simulated and real flights. Measured signal processing was done using standard time-series analysis (Mean R-R and SDNN) and also using recurrence quantification analysis. The results indicate that both standard and recurrence quantification analysis parameters were able to distinguish between two groups of measurements (simulated vs. real flights) at the significance level of p<0.05.

The focus was placed on an experimental testing of solid wood and wood-based composite materials used as a sheathing of vented façade systems with bonded joints. The potential of this arrangement was verified through experimental easurements. Two different test methods, defined by relevant European and Czech standards, were adopted and modified. Moreover, the frost resistance of some test specimens was determined by subjecting them to a cyclic action of freezing and thawing. Another group of specimens was subjected to conditioning with sudden temperature changes and finally, the substructure bonding retention to the cladding and strength in shear in tension stress were tested, analyzed and discussed. The obtained data revealed that the crucial factor for the bonded joint is not its strength but the quality and stiffness of the cladding material or of the substructure.

Gender differences and wellbeing values in adolescent online shopping,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the gender differentiation of adolescents in their online shopping motivation based on utilitarian and hedonic values as an expression of well-being. It is necessary to find out whether and to what extent utilitarian and hedonic values act as motivations in online shopping. The aim was to find whether boys and girls differ in their average individual values representing motivators in a specific, individual online shopping behavior, while assuming that a higher frequency of occurrence of the value areas represents a higher level of well-being. Design/methodology/approach: The research focused on finding if individual motivational areas of online shopping, in which utilitarian and hedonic values are applied, are differently represented by Slovak boys and girls. The research sample comprised of the Slovak adolescents (n=420, AM age=16.75). A modified questionnaire investigated the motivation for online shopping. Findings: Research findings pointed to a higher degree of well-being in adolescents’ online shopping motivational structures based on utilitarian and hedonic motivations. The research study indicated different motivational structure based on utilitarian and hedonic values which are associated with online shopping behavior of the adolescents in relation to their gender. The outcomes showed that there was a larger representation of the utilitarian values related to online shopping by adolescent boys. The adolescent boys more often appreciated choice, availability of information, lack of sociality and cost savings. Adolescent boys and girls had equal hedonistic value motivations. Practical implications: At the time of the digital marketing boom, the knowledge of adolescents’ behavior in the online shopping environment is important for marketing communication. Adolescents will represent a strong segment of buyers in the digital market in the near future. Thus, aiming for the improvement in well-being by respecting the gender differentiation, retailers could create a more effective marketing communication design that would be targeted at the current Generation Z. The findings are important for the preparation and creation of the design of the online-activities marketing in individual cultural regions. Originality/value: There is a notable absence in the monitoring of the well-being values in adolescent online shopping in Europe, especially in the post-communist EU countries. The Slovak Republic is one of the dynamically developing post-communist countries of the EU. Its position in the OECD which measures subjective well-being is very low. The research can become a starting point for forming the theory of online shopping behavior, assuming gender unification in the areas of hedonic values and motivations not only for the Generation Z but for all online shopping consumers in the second decade of the twenty-first century. The presented research is thus practical in order to adequately set up the online communication and the research use of a diagnostic tool in the European space. The authors see the research as a pilot study, which gives the opportunity for subsequent intercultural comparison. Knowledge of gender differences and indicators of well-being tendencies in the motivational structure of adolescents may be applicable for supporting and regulating the online shopping behavior of adolescents, as well as for the explanation and theoretical modeling of this behavior.",50204.0,"Sramova, Blandina:Pavelka, Jiří",International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management,5,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0
"Antenatal assessment of liver position, rather than lung-to-head ratio (LHR) or observed/expected LHR, is predictive of outcome in fetuses with isolated left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia","Respiratory morbidity in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is associated with high mortality and adverse outcome. Accurate prenatal diagnosis is essential for prognosis and potential treatment in utero. The aim was to evaluate the prenatal ultrasound findings in assessing the respiratory prognosis in fetuses with isolated left-sided CDH. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 59 prenatally diagnosed left-sided CDH cases managed at a tertiary perinatal center. RESULTS: Survival rate in the study group was 73% (43/59). We found no statistically significant relationship between survival and the presence of polyhydramnios, gestational age at diagnosis, lung-to-head ratio (LHR) and observed/expected LHR (O/E LHR) values, gestational age at birth and birth weight. Intrathoracic liver herniation was a statistically significant parameter adversely affecting survival (37.2% in survivors, 68.8% in non-survivors, p = 0.031) and logistic regression confirmed this relationship. The presence of pneumothorax and severe pulmonary hypertension were significantly associated with mortality (82% non-survivors versus 15% in survivors, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Intrathoracic liver herniation seems to be a reliable parameter in the prediction of survival and neonatal respiratory morbidity in fetuses with isolated left-sided CDH.

These broad peaks of MM underlie the narrower peaks of metabolites and often complicate their quantification but they also may have potential importance as biomarkers in specific diseases. Thus, separation of broad MM signals from low molecular weight metabolites enables accurate determination of metabolite concentrations and is of primary interest in many studies. Other studies attempt to understand the origin of the MM spectrum, to decompose it into individual spectral regions or peaks and to use the components of the MM spectrum as markers of various physiological or pathological conditions in biomedical research or clinical practice.

"A Study of Selective Laser Melting Technology on the Ultra-High Strength Tool Steel Use—Quality, Mechanical Properties and Fatigue","During the last few years, laser based powder bed fusion (PBF) processes have received an increasing attention as a section of additive manufacturing technologies with a rapidly growing number of established and potential industrial applications. This paper investigates the effect that key parameters in PBF processes have on critical material properties in high-alloyed steel samples, manufactured under controlled process conditions such as scanning strategy, energy density and orientation of samples in the build chamber.  A Concept Laser M2 Cusing Machine, (Concept Laser, Lichtenfels, Germany) was used for the fabrication of samples made from MARLOK® C1650, an independent maraging (precipitation hardening) tool steel. This steel is specially designed to be used in highly demanding applications, including tools for aluminum die casting in long series with high requirements for surface quality in the product and high fatigue resistance in the tooling.  Two series of samples were made with different hatch spacing of the laser beam and with different orientation and angles in the build chamber. The samples were prepared according to relevant standards including CNC machining, with exception for a few samples that were kept in as-built condition for comparison.  Evaluation of the 3D surface quality of the machined samples and the morphology of the fracture were done with the contact-less Alicona Infinite G4 machine and a Tescan Mira 3GM scanning electron microscope. Fatigue testing was performed with an Instron 8874 Servohydraulic Dynamic Testing machine. The investigations include the influence of process parameters on mechanical properties in the final material, as well as the effect on the parameters measured in cyclic material fatigue tests.

Proven technology of Laser Shock Peening (LSP) process for the cavitation erosion resistance improvement,"Development of the Laser Shock Peening (LSP) process which when applied can improve the resistance to the cavitation erosion in pumps. The basic principle of the LSP technology The high-energy laser after passing the confining medium is forming a high-pressure plasma. By this principle, shock waves are generated and they are plastically deforming the material and inducing deep compressed residual stresses. In such a principle, certain mechanical properties of the material are changed and typical improvements are prolonged fatigue life, prevention of the corrosion stress cracking, or wear resistance improvement. Additionally, the hardness can be improved as well. Cavitation erosion is a fatigue driven phenomenon, and by applying the LSP the cavitation erosion can be reduced and slowed down. The LSP was applied to the blades which in the end form the pump impeller.

Effects of axonal spatial distribution and diameter on diffusion MR simulations,"Introduction: Since the introduction of diffusion tensor imaging [1], more complex models have been derived including some capable of estimating axonal diameter, density and other biophysical parameters [2-6]. One limitation of the models is that they may over-estimate diameters [5]. Although several complex Monte-Carlo (MC) simulators have been introduced [7-9], we present an intra-axonal compartment MC simulation framework, with lower computational requirements. It is due to the fact that, for a given diameter and fiber orientation, the signal from a single simulated fiber is sufficient to approximate the overall signal from a fiber population. We also show that fiber diameter causes characteristic changes in ratio between parallel and perpendicular diffusion MRI (dMRI) signal.  Methods: For Brownian motion simulation inside geometrically constrained space, we have modified J.

Medieval Women Revisited,"Just over 25 years ago the Centre for Medieval Studies of the University of York launched a new interdisciplinary MA pathway 'Women and the the Later Medieval World' and at much the same time hosted an international conference entitled 'Medieval Women'. Since that time the study of medieval women has evolved considerably, though interest in the study of gender and particularly masculinity has raised questions as to how we now relate to and engage with the study of women's lives and experience in the medieval past. Recent scholarship has moreover returned to some of the questions that were pioneering a quarter of a century ago, particularly in relation to the 'status' of women after the Black Death. By revisiting the theme of medieval women, this conference seeks to explore where scholarship, particularly scholarship first inspired by the 'Women and the Later Medieval World' has taken us. This then is both an exploration and a celebration. It is also an opportunity to welcome scholars from Central Europe who a quarter of a century ago saw their world transformed by the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Velvet Revolution and the collapse of authoritarian communist regimes. We are delighted that the conference is supported by the Department of History of the Palacký University, the Czech Republic.

Evaluating adhesion of weatherproofing sealant joints: Price vs. quality,"Joint sealing in facades of buildings is a technologically very complicated process that cannot be solved without connection to other constructions. To ensure proper functionality of the joint it is necessary to use a suitable sealant. The core idea of this experiment was general conviction that the more expensive material or product is used the better properties it should demonstrate. For presented experimental measurements only polyurethane sealants that are intended for usage in exterior were selected. The selection of tested sealants was based on previous experiences as well as on some previous laboratory experiments. The performed experiments involved verification of adhesive and cohesive sealant properties to the selected substrate. Even though the obtained data demonstrate that high quality sealants were selected, certain differences between cheap and expensive test specimens had appeared.",0.0,"Liška, Pavel:Nečasová, Barbora:Šlanhof, Jiří",Advances and Trends in Engineering Sciences and Technologies II,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Identification of improvised explosives residues using physical-chemical analytical methods under real conditions after an explosion,"Within the analysis of cases relating to the use of explosives for crimes, we have experienced a shift from using industrial explosives towards substances made in amateur and illegal way. Availability of industrial explosives is increasingly limited to a narrow sphere of subjects with a relevant permission. Thus, on the part of perpetrators, terrorists, ever greater attention is paid to illegal production of explosives that are easily made from readily available raw materials. Another alarming fact is the availability of information found on the internet. Procedures of preparation are often very simple and do not require even a deeper professional knowledge. Explosive characteristics are not actually accessible for many of these substances (detonation velocity, sensitivity, working capacity, brisance, physical and chemical stability, etc.). It is directed towards preparation of these explosives also in non-stoichiometric mixtures, conducting test explosives, determination of explosive characteristics (if they are unknown) and analysis of both primary phases and post-blast residues through available analytical techniques, such as gas and liquid chromatography with mass detection, FTIR, micro-Raman spectrometry, electron microscopy with microanalysis and Raman microspectrometry directly in SEM chamber for analysis at the level of individual microparticles.

Hydrogen Technologies in Czech Republic,"Although not really expected, activities in the field of hydrogen technologies date in the Czech Republic more or less 5 decades back to the history. It is true, this tradition was broken for substantial time in seventies and eighties of the past century, but there was a solid fundament to build up on. This, together with technical and technological skill of the people in the country, helped significantly when re-establishing activities in this field two decades earlier. And the same aspect hopefully helps also in the future development. First systematic research in the field of hydrogen technologies, or more specifically fuel cells, was related to the nickel and KOH-based systems in sixties of 20th century. Possibility to utilize this technology as a power source was studied in the development laboratories of CˇKD Praha, Semiconductor Division. They succeeded in the construction of 1 kW stack. This was a logical choice due to several reasons. As the main ones the following may be given: ?Alkaline system is relatively undemanding regarding the materials needed. It concerned primarily the polymer electrolyte required for the acidic PEM systems not accessible in the Soviet bloc in sufficient amount and quality. ? ČKD Praha?s main focus was electric traction and alternatives to the traditional approaches were sought. ? Alkaline systems have still globally represented the main trend in this field at a given time period. Unfortunately, this research was abandoned relatively soon in the beginning of eighties. Two-fold reasons for this may be considered. One of them is represented by limited resources available especially for the fuel cells components to be imported from outside Soviet bloc. Another aspect represents the fact that technology development under this political ideology was often limited to the optimization of the existing approaches over the introducing innovative, break-through technologies.",10405.0,"Bouzek, Karel:Paidar, Martin:Stehlík, Karin",Hydrogen in an International Context: Vulnerabilities of Hydrogen Energy in Emerging Markets,5,low,low,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cationic octahedral molybdenum cluster complexes functionalized with mitochondria-targeting ligands: photodynamic anticancer and antibacterial activities,"Octahedral molybdenum cluster complexes have recently come forth as pertinent singlet oxygen photosensitizers towards biological applications. Still, their phototoxic efficiency in the absence of nanocarriers remains limited due to their poor cellular uptake. Here, two cationic octahedral molybdenum cluster complexes, bearing carboxylate ligands with triphenylphosphonium (1) or N-methyl pyridinium (2) mitochondria- targeting terminal functions, have been designed and synthesized. Their photophysical properties in water and in vitro biological activity were investigated in the context of blue-light photodynamic therapy of cancer and photoinactivation of bacteria. Upon blue light irradiation, complex 1 displays red luminescence with a quantum yield of 0.24 in water, whereas complex 2 is much less emissive (ΦL &lt, 0.01). Nevertheless, both complexes efficiently produce singlet oxygen, O2(1Δg). Complex 1 is rapidly internalized into HeLa cells and accumulated in mitochondria, followed by relocation to lysosomes and clearance at longer times. In contrast, the more hydrophilic 2 is not internalized into HeLa cells, highlighting the effect of the apical ligands on the uptake properties. The treatment with 1 results in an intensive phototoxic effect under 460 nm irradiation (IC50 = 0.10 ± 0.02 μM), which exceeds by far those previously reported for octahedral cluster-based molecular photosensitizers. The ratio between phototoxicity and dark toxicity is approximately 50 and evidences a therapeutic window for the application of 1 in blue-light photodynamic therapy. Complex 1 also enters and efficiently photoinactivates Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, documenting its suitability as a blue-light photosensitizer for antimicrobial applications.",20501.0,"Kirakci, Kaplan:Zelenka, Jaroslav:Rumlová, Michaela:Cvačka, Josef:Ruml, Tomáš:Lang, Kamil",Biomaterials Science,5,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Rather than expecting scientists to communicate their latest results aimed to be published in a scientific journal, the conference wants to offer, in the form of so-called Tutorial Talks, scientists an opportunity to speak about their research, their intellectual and emotional struggles, their aha!-moments, their provocative thoughts and their acquired wisdom in relation to their chosen topic. In addition to being beneficial for specialists in a given field, Tutorial Talks should foster communication and understanding between various branches of NMR. MMCE aims to address all walks of theoretical and applied NMR spectroscopy, ranging from fundamental theory through small-molecule structure determination, new pulse sequences, software and hardware development, etc. to biological molecules.

Possibilities of Reducing Radiation Dose in Computed Tomography Examinations in Various Age Groups Using an Iterative Model-Based Reconstruction Technique,"Aim: To determine whether iterative model-based reconstruction (IMR) technique can preserve computed tomography (CT) image quality when the radiation dose is reduced to 20% of the original value. Methods: CT examination of the neck, mediastinum, or stomach was performed using standard protocols with a Philips Healthcare MDCT 64. Fifty imaging studies were evaluated. The patient’s set was divided into three groups: Young, Preadolescent, and Adult. Four experienced evaluators assessed the CT scans reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP) and IMR technique (using the L1BR, L2BR, and L2BSP levels) at a 100% dose and at a dose reduced by 80%. The dose was reduced by a decrease in milliampere seconds (mAs). Image noise, artifacts, anatomical details, sharpness, low-contrast resolution, general impression of the reconstructed image, possibility of influencing the description, and possibility of influencing the examination’s conclusion were assessed. FBP at 100% of mAs was always used as the basis for comparison. Decrease in a parameter meant a negative point score while an improvement was marked as positive. Subsequently, objective measurement of image quality was also performed. Results: The greatest improvement in image quality (relative to the quality of images reconstructed using FBP with 100% dose) was achieved using IMR L2BR reconstruction, which can be recommended as optimal. The IMR L2BR reconstruction method was statistically demonstrated to have the best performance among the tested methods in suppressing noise and artifacts. In relation to the selected indications, this method allows a reduction in dose by as much as 80%. The effect of IMR was less marked among the youngest patients than in the remaining two patient groups. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that use of the IMR technique preserves diagnostic indications even with a markedly reduced dose in CT examinations of the neck, thorax, and abdomen in various age groups.",0.0,"Červinková, Ivana:Walek, Petr:Jíra, Igor:Skotáková, Jarmila:Šenkyřík, Jan:Ouředníček, Petr:Jan, Jiří",Pediatrics & Therapeutics,5,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Segmented fractal pore structure covering nano- and micro-ranges in cementing composites produced with GGBS,"y Ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) is a massively produced waste in iron-making process. In present work, the pore size range of GGBS blended cementing composites is finely segmented to reveal the scale-dependent fractal nature of pore surface. Results indicate that structural complexity and irregularity of C-S-H gels can be improved by GGBS. It is proved that an increase in the pore surface area helps to improve the complexity (fractal dimension, D-s) of the pore wall. Linear growth of D-s with specific surface area exists in almost all pore ranges, especially in mesopore ranges. Fractal dimension in gel pore range shows the highest value, while the value in pore range of 1-10 mu m is almost the lowest. The macro region above 1 mu m, which is an aggregation of hydrated packing grains, shows a permanent-existing fractal behavior. The capillary pores between 10 nm and 1 mu m exhibits drifting non-fractal behavior, from micron-scale to nano-scale with curing time. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Systematic Education of State Employees as Necessary Condition for the Provision of Quality Service,"Among  the  priorities  of  the  Government  of  the  Czech  Republic  is  the  provision  of  services  to  its citizens,  which  are  provided  by  state  organizations.  The  current  trend  demands  for  employees  of  these organizations  to  provide  their  services  in  a  good  and  professional  manner.  Top  management  of  these organizations  realizes  that  they  are  their  employees  who  provide  these  services  in  the  exercise  of  their profession. It is a prerequisite to have employees in their ranks who can fully use their knowledge and skills in their jobs. This knowledge and skills need to be constantly developed and improved. One of the tools to achieve this is to offer its employees various forms of further education in the organization. State organizations should have established forms of systematic education for their employees.

Preparation of magnetic sorbent with surface modified by C18 for removal of selected organic pollutants from aqueous samples,"Magnetic sorbents have great potential in environmental applications due to their simple synthesis and separation in magnetic field, usability in heterogeneous systems and low toxicity. Possible syntheses, surface modifications and characteristics were described by Li et al 2013. This type of solid-phase extraction is being successfully used in various fields as health care, microbiology, biotechnologies or sample preconcentration in analytical chemistry. In this preliminary study we report on the preparation and application of magnetically separable sorbent with surface modified by C18 alkyl chain for purification of water contaminated by environmentally hazardous organic compounds. Magnetic cores were co-precipitated from Fe2+ and Fe3+ chlorides in alkalic aqueous solution. Surface of synthetized Fe3O4 was modified with SiO2 by tetraethylorthosilicate to assure physico-chemical stability. Furthermore, Fe3O4/SiO2 complex has been treated by C18 functional group, which provides good affinity towards hydrophobic substances in water. Efficiency of sorption under various conditions has been examined on benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX), compounds found in petroleum products which contaminate air, soil and groundwater near of store tanks.

Perilipin-2: A new prospective biomarker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial ischemia,"Many scientists have been looking for faster, more accurate and confirmatory biomarkers of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim has been to investigate an assay for the determination of perilipin-2 in human serum, and to check its clinical relevance as a marker of acute myocardial infarction (AMI First type). We have analytically and clinically examined a sandwich ELISA for perilipin-2 measurement. The Perilipin-2 serum level did not differentiate between men and women, but individuals with AMI showed to have higher concentrations of this marker. Perilipin-2 correlated with the serum TNF-α, ultra-sensitive (us) CRP, cystatinC and negatively with Apolipoprotein A1, HDL cholesterol and adiponectin. Using ROC analysis, it was found that the diagnostic efficiency of perilipin-2 was (excellent) and significantly higher than the others.

Approaches to estimation the farm-level economic viability and sustainability in agriculture: A literature review,"Estimation of farm economic sustainability and viability became more topical when redesigning the Common Agricultural Policy which should stabilise farm income and make agribusiness more viable and sustainable (typically in Czech areas facing natural constraints). The key question is how to calculate the income of farms or farm households not only to survive but also to grow sustainably. The article summarises and compares knowledge from 51 studies to provide a comprehensive discussion on different ways how to measure economic viability and sustainability to set income support for farms in the areas with natural constraints optimally. The authors found family farms and off-farm income as important limitations of FADN database (Farm Accountancy Data Network) for evaluation of the economic sustainability of farm household. Moreover, some financial ratios (Return on Assets – ROA and assets turnover) are not suitable viability indicators for farms with a high share of hired land (typically large legal entities). Joining family farms and legal entities, the authors recommend using modified Farm Net Value Added (MFNVA) allowing for opportunity costs of own land and non-land assets. The average wage in the economy or region is a better proxy for opportunity labour costs of unpaid work rather than average agricultural wage.",50202.0,"Špička, Jindřich:Hlavsa, Tomáš:Soukupová, Kateřina:Štolbová, Marie",Agricultural Economics,5,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to various studies and researches performed, the atheists seem to be basically the strongest and worldwide potential target group for the Church. Though, living in its, dream., the Church seeks those who believe or are in search of themselves and the most significant target group of atheists is being ignored. However, the reality shows that the trend is quite different - the Church meets different conditions (although the need for it stays firm, both environment and culture are dynamically changing), so the Church must offer something new, something innovative to both attract and satisfy its target group. Therefore it is necessary to understand the customer&apos,s needs, their behavioural customs, and their opinion in relation to the Church.

Soil samples were investigated from the organic O and mineral B horizons. Arsenic was strongly adsorbed in B hori-zons on Fe phases, while antimony was predominantly bound in O horizons. The variability of Fe/As ratio in soil solutions and wa-ters was related with surface properties of colloids and explained by model calculation. Most of Fe remained in large colloids with a low surface area, whereas maximum As was included in small particles with a high surface area.

Helicene-SPP Based Chiral Plasmonic Hybrid Structure: Toward Direct Enantiomers SERS Discrimination.,"Achieving chiral-plasmon response based on the combination of achiral plasmonic nanostructures with highly chiral surrounding medium represents an attractive way for creation of hybrid optically active plasmonic materials. In this work, we present an attractive design and fabrication of chiral plasmon substrates based on a surface plasmon-polariton supported structure coupled with extremely optically active helicene enantiomers. Such approach allows us to excite chiral plasmon waves and to design optically active SERS substrates. Its further combination with standard Raman spectroscopy makes possible enantio-selective detection/recognition of optical enantiomers with detection limits below those of standard spectral techniques. The chiral optical response of new plasmonic system was observed and controlled by the optical rotation of helicenes.

New Risks in OHS with Focus on Selected Nanotechnological Workplaces,"Nanotechnology is part of a group of “new risks” that have not been addressed at all from the point of view of the occupation health and safety (OHS). The basic precondition for risk management is based on sufficient information about nanomaterials used i.e. their behavior and properties, exposure to toxic effects etc. Because of the many uncertainties that nanomaterials possess, the application of the standard risk management approach is ineffective. For this reason, Control Branding (C) methods are gradually introduced and are used to assess exposure when exposure limit values are not set. Selected workplaces (engineering, agricultural production, human activities and food production) were selected as part of the article and measurements (Testo DiSCmini device) confirming the main sources of nanomaterial production in anthropogenic industrial production or in operations of human activity. Subsequently, they identified the way they were distributed in the technological space and found the factors in this space that played a role in changing the concentration or properties of the nanoparticles and their distribution. In the group of tested workplaces, the highest risk was found in the smelting and casting of aluminum, and copper soldering in the engineering production.

The Future Has Already Passed,"The article describes the unique position science fiction has acquired in relationship with temporality, especially futurity. It is suggested that this position stems partly from a strategic position “popular literature” in general occupies in western culture. Niklas Luhmann and his theory of autopoietic social systems serves as a starting point that allows the author to view temporality as a human construct. This is further demonstrated by describing the impact the formulation of second thermodynamic law had on popular imagination of the nineteenth century and how it led to the formulation of the basis of theory of information in the first half of the twentieth century. In order to illustrate the capacity of science fiction vocabulary to deal with the present, seemingly a-historic situation of the world, the “technological fate of humanity”, and “information society”, DeLillo’s non-fiction article “In the Ruins of the Future”, devoted to the events of 9/11, has been chosen.",0.0,"Kotásek, Miroslav",Bohemica litteraria,5,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Identifications of small peripheral towns at the turn of the 21st century : cultural heritage, use of historical examples, and revitalization strategies in comparative perspective","The article is exploring the cities&apos, role in the nation-branding and identification processes. It is based on analysis of the development and revival strategies used by small towns placed in regions distant from Capitals, in deep countryside, peripheral in socio-economic sense, and in geographic as well. The content of their strategies, the outcomes, the impact, their motivation and the context has been analysed. The sources were statistics, periodical press, publicity leaflets, and presentations of all kinds, regional historiography, and observations, which were carried since late 1990&apos,. These strategies have been explored on the basis of three case studies: Gers in Gascony in the South-West France, Třebíčsko in Vysočina in the Czech Republic, and Dukla in Šariš in Slovakia, bringing Western and East-Central Europe into comparative perspective. As a part of the revival strategy, the small towns have attempted to construct an identity supported by historical examples that locate them within larger - regional, national and supranational - identities. They have discovered the power of history to brand them. In all three regions also the attempt to reach the registration in the List of World Cultural Heritage (UNESCO) was successful. They have decided to display their historical and cultural heritage as a marketable value. In this context differences, similarities, analogic situations, and interconnections have been identified between local (urban), regional and national, and supranational identities on the case of Gascony, Gers respectively, which is compared and contrasted to the Czech and Slovak cases.",60101.0,"Klusáková, Luďa",Novoe Proshloe/The New Past,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pigments from Filamentous Ascomycetes for Combination Therapy,"Filamentous ascomycetes (Neurospora and Monascus) have been studied for a long time because of their production of secondary metabolites such as microbial pigments. The ascomycetes represent an interesting group of compounds with high potential for medicinal applications. Many recent studies have shown their efficacy in the treatment of serious pathological states such as oncological diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and hyperlipidaemia. Nevertheless, the clinical usability of ascomycetes is still limited. However, this problem can be solved by the use of these compounds with combinations of other therapeutic agents. This strategy can suppress their side effects and improve their therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, their co-application can significantly enhance conventional therapies that are used.

Catching up or falling behind in European agriculture – the case of milk production,"The paper explores and analyses the catching up and falling behind processes in the European agricultural sector using a stochastic metafrontier multiple output distance function for 24 EU member states from 2004 to 2011. The metafrontier estimates reveal considerable productivity differences in milk production across the EU at the regional (NUTS2) level. Productivity is the highest in the old member states, especially in those regions located in the northwest of the EU, while the lowest productivity is observed in Eastern Europe. The same structure was found for both TFP (Total Factor Productivity) and TFP development. Moreover, the results for technical change suggest that farm sizes are not optimal in many regions in Central and Eastern Europe from a dynamic perspective. The comparative analysis suggests that in the new compared to the old member states, fewer farms could benefit from the movement on the frontier. Moreover, there are no signs that poorly performing farms are catching up to the best performing farms in the regions/countries.",0.0,"Čechura, Lukáš:Grau, Aaron:Hockmann, Heinrich:Levkovych, Inna:Žáková Kroupová, Zdeňka",Journal of Agricultural Economics,5,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Set-theoretic methodology using fuzzy sets in rule extraction and validation - consistency and coverage revisited,"The use of set-theoretic concepts of consistency and coverage and their fuzzified versions needs to be accompanied with an extension of the general (non-fuzzy) methodology. In the fuzzy context, the same piece of data can provide partial evidence in favour of the existence of a given relationship, and at the same time contribute to its disproof, which constitutes a significant interpretation and methodological issue. We point out the possible problems of the use of these measures fuzzified in direct analogy to their non-fuzzy counterparts in the investigation of relationships and causality. We propose two alternative fuzzifications of these measures to be used in the set-theoretic framework and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). We also introduce novel degree-of-support and degree-of-disproof measures to handle simultaneous subset relations. In this way, simultaneous partial support for- and disproof of a given rule by the given set of data can be analyzed in detail. The suggested measures can enhance the insights needed in theory building and be widely used in research using fuzzified set-theoretic methods for the assessment of the plausibility of the rules.

It concludes that the European Parliamentary elections are in danger of becoming the third-order contest with barely more relevance than a public opinion poll in the Czech Republic. This is because the European Union does not matter much in the Czech Republic and the European elections generally are unpopular and undervalued there. There are several reasons for this but one of the most important is very limited knowledge of the EU among Czech citizens.

Elastic properties prediction models of continuous fibers composites,"The determination of engineering constants and how these are best applied in practice is an important theoretical basis of modern composites design. Specific characterization of the composite material’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios, are values that enable the identification of elastic constants that determine the stiffness matrix. These key datum need to be precisely determined to accurately model any composite material behaviour under finite element analysis. The prediction of material properties in longitudinal direction is the most straightforward to calculate. However it is often far more difficult to predict properties in transversal directions. Additional factors need to be considered in the analysis of transverse behaviour in composite materials. Therefore far more data is needed to model composite material behaviour in transverse directions, where each can influence the results in unique ways. Empirical testing that matches the predicted and any theoretical results not only validates the model, but is a satisfying goal of the skilled engineer. In practice, there are many prediction methods used to model composite material behaviour. These can be best separated into several definitive groups according to model derivation.

Air quality in archives housed in historic buildings: Assessment of concentration of indoor particles of outdoor origin.,"Indoor air pollution in archives can cause irreversible degradation of materials stored there. Thus, detailed informationnabout indoor air quality is essential before control strategies could be investigated. In a period 2008–2019, the relationship between the indoor and outdoor pollution was investigated in four naturally ventilated archives located in historical buildings and situated in regions with different outdoor air quality. The indoor and outdoor particle number, mass, and chemical size distributions were measured during different seasons. Moreover, air change rates (a), penetration coefficients (P), and deposition velocities (Vd) were determined. The results revealed that the most important source of the indoor particulate matter was the outdoor air. The size-resolved data with no indoor sources were evaluated using the steady-state solution of the mass balance equation as the I/O ratio. The results showed that all parameters (a, P, and Vd) determined in archives were comparable with low seasonal variation, probably due to the similar building characteristics. Further, the typical average values of the I/O ratio for naturally ventilated historical buildings were estimated. Finally, the long-term indoor concentrations, for periods when no measurement was in place, were determined using data from the local monitoring network. The results showed that the higher level of pollution and therefore the higher degree of degradation is expected in depositories located in highly polluted regions.",60401.0,"Mašková, Ludmila:Smolík, Jiří:Ondráček, Jakub:Ondráčková, Lucie:Trávníčková, Tereza:Havlica, Jaromír",Building and Environment,5,low,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Effect of Amygdalin in the Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma induced in the Buccal Pouch of Golden Syrian Hamster,"Background: Scientific studies have recently focused on the alternative and complementary medicine as a wide spread method in treating a lot of diseases, including cancer. Cancer that is considered as a lifethreatening disease affect patients all over the world. Traditional medicine still does not provide patients with permanent and absolute solution to their suffering, especially in terminal cases of cancer. Many people go for using alternative and natural methods to reduce as possible as they can the pain and the side effect of this awful disease. Amygdalin, extracted from the seeds of apricot and almond, is under debate as a true cure of cancer and many other diseases. Therefore, we wanted through this study to evaluate the efficiency of Amygdalin in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, the most common carcinoma in the oral cavity, induced in Syrian Hamster and approach in which pathway this substance does arrest the cancer cells. Materials and methods: 20 Hamsters were divided into two groups, cases group (10 Hamsters), that has been treated with Amygdalin, and control group (10 Hamsters) that has not received any treatment. The carcinogenic material that has been used was (DMPA) and the immunohistochemistry stains were P53 and Ki67. Results and conclusions: There is a significant statistic difference between the two groups as to the P53 as well as to the Ki67.

Community and Exclusion.

Scholars have pointed out that violence is an inherent part of the conflict in interethnic and interreligious relationships, although violence was not always first marked by ethnic conflicts, but rather social ones, as the example of the food riots in Cisleithania during WW I has shown. Despite these achievements of the historiography on collective violence in modern Central Europe, it seems that different research milieus still remain separate from one another.

Sensitivity and Performance of Energetic Materials,"This paper provides an overview of the main developments over the past nine years in the study of the sensitivity of energetic materials (EM) to impact, shock, friction, electric spark, laser beams and heat. Attention is also paid to performance and to its calculation methods. Summaries are provided of the relationships between sensitivity and performance, the best representations for the calculation methods of performance being the volume heat of explosion or the product of crystal density and the square of detonation velocity. On the basis of current knowledge, it is possible to state that a single universal relationship between molecular structure and initiation reactivity does not yet exist. It is confirmed that increasing the explosive strength is usually accompanied by an increase in the sensitivity. In the case of nitramines this rule is totally valid for friction sensitivity, but for impact sensitivity there are exceptions to the rule, and with 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazepane, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane, beta-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane and the and alpha-, beta- and epsilon-polymorphs of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane the relationship works in the opposite direction.

Design and Experimental Evaluation of Phase Change Material Based Cooling Ceiling System,"This article deals with the possibility of using PCMs in cooling ceiling systems to reduce significantly air temperature fluctuations and energy demands for cooling. The PCM-based cooling ceiling&apos,s technical design was performed, and a prototype was realized in this research. The experimental verification of the proposed system was performed to determine the actual parameters in different operational modes and their comparison with the same cooling ceiling system without PCM. The transient simulations in the TRNSYS simulation software were also carried out and validated with experiments. Based on the findings, the complex simulations were performed for application under the specific climatic conditions of Czechia. This work contains a comprehensive approach from the prototype design, through the experiments and partial simulations, to complex simulations based on the specific parameters and an economic evaluation. The results of this work show the ability of the proposed cooling ceiling solution to reduce temperature peaks by up to 3.2 $^circ$C, while energy savings can be up to 27 %, depending on the air change rate.

Empirical evaluation of professional traineeships for young people up to 30 years of age,"In this article, we evaluate ‘Professional traineeships for young people up to 30 years’, an active labour market policy measure implemented in the Czech Republic. Professional traineeships were one of the possibilities for suitable offer to young people within Youth Guarantee in the Czech Republic in 2014 and 2015. First, we conducted a process evaluation (document analysis and interviews) to uncover the design and implementation aspects of the program. Next, we followed the counterfactual impact evaluation approach towards the estimate of returns to unemployment (competing risk analysis) based on individual administration data from public employment services. We have found that professional traineeships were successful in attracting the interest of both young people and employers. Mainly young people with middle and high level education have entered the program. Most of them have been provided with on-the-job subsidies in the private sector. When considering the impact of the program on the unemployment of participants and a control group, it was shown that after two years, the measure was effective only for young people with long pre-program Employment Office registration.

Historical Water Supply System of the City of Brno - Social-Environmental Consequences,"This paper provides a detailed look into the historical development of the water supply system of a big industrial city and its impact on the river environment and needs of the wastewater treatment system. The city of Brno, Czech Republic, was chosen for this study because it has a long history in the field of water supply, and the city has changed rapidly over the last 200 years. The city’s development necessitated an adaptation of drinking water sources, most significantly the use of the Březová nad Svitavou facility, which resulted in a change of condition of the Svitava River. The notable decrease in river flow, aided by industrial development of settlements within the Svitava River catchment between 1850 and 1950, strongly contributed to the spread of river pollution. However, the construction of wastewater treatment plants during recent decades led to a restoration of river quality and, consequently, of the entire environment of the Svitava River catchment. This paper also presents a view on activities connected with the long term surface water quality monitoring and improvement with regard to water quality conditions in spring areas and the river network influenced by the water supply system.",60301.0,"Honek, D.:Forejtníková, M.:Rozkošný, M.:Vyskočil, Aleš",Water,5,medium,medium,0,0,medium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Critical Infrastructure and Integrated Protection,"Traditionally, the society is dependent on the various services and hence on the infrastructures that provide these services. With growing urbanization, some of these infrastructures, which are vital to the society, have begun to be criticized. At present, critical infrastructure is a very complex and increasingly interconnected system that must be resilient on almost every-day anthropogenic and naturogenic threats. Consequently, new security measures are being continuously developed to ensure adequate protection of critical infrastructure. The monography that you get in your hands is conceived in five separate but very tight chapters. The introductory part presents basic strategic documents and approaches to critical infrastructure protection in the European Union. It then characterizes the security environment and its impact on critical infrastructure. Major chapters are critical infrastructure risks and security analysis of critical infrastructure elements.

Cost Assessment of Training Using Constructive Simulation,"Modeling and simulation represent a common part of most human activities.

Computer simulation offers many new views on the modeling and simulation while allowing penetration of simulation into other disciplines. Simulation has an irreplaceable role in the fields of training and education for centuries. Its application and development are largely associated with its use in the military. There is an analogous situation with constructive simulation, which is used as a tool for training of commanders and staffs of military units. The benefits of simulation for a higher quality of training are beyond doubt. Therefore, constructive simulation gradually penetrates into other spheres such as the training of emergency staff. However, relevant studies about the economic benefits of the use of constructive simulation for training are relatively rare.

Travelling Virtual Balise for ETCS,"A great effort of railway industry is currently focused on exploitation of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for the European Train Control System (ETCS). It has been assessed that replacement of track balises, used for safe train location determination, with Virtual Balises (VBs) detected by means of GNSS will significantly reduce the track-side infrastructure and operational costs. However, this innovated ETCS can be put into operations only in the case when detection of VBs by means of GNSS will achieve the same Safety Integrity Level (SIL 4) and availability as it is required for physical balise groups. This paper describes a novel Travelling Virtual Balise (TVB) concept, which was proposed to meet demanding ETCS safety requirements for GNSS using the existing EGNOS Safety-of-Life (SoL) service. The TVB concept profits from the basic feature of GNSS – i.e. the ability of abundant train position determination in GNSS service volume, what cannot be realised by current track balise groups with a spacing of hundreds of meters or more. The frequent GNSS train positions are namely utilized for: 1) fast diagnostics of on-board Location Determination System (LDS), 2) introduction of reactive fail-safety into LDS, and 3) derivation and justification of the ETCS safety requirements for EGNOS. The TVB concept brings one significant advantage to ETCS in contrast to the static VBs – i.e. the safety requirement for LDS doesn’t depend longer on the distance between successive Virtual Balises. It means that the existing spacing between physical balise groups (up to 2.5 km) can be also preserved in case of TVBs. It can significantly improve the availability of LDS. Further it was found that a less demanding THR requirement for GNSS of about 1e-7 / 1 hour or more still enables to meet the ETCS THR requirement for VB determination, i.e. THRVB of 0.67e-9/ 1 hour.",20202.0,"Filip, Aleš",International Journal of Transport Development and Integration,5,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Communication Strategies in Non-state Non-profit Organizations in the Czech Republic,"The functioning of NGO's in the Czech Republic has been influenced by radical changes in the laws in recent years. The revolution in the non-profit sector was caused by the law on social services (108/2006 Coll.) and particularly the civil code (89/2012 Coll.), which regulates particular forms of non-state non-profit organizations in a new way, and also defines the concept of public benefit. Organizations in the non-profit sector are struggling with a variety of problems. These include the lack of funds, high rate of staff turnover and uncertainty. Still many remain in the non-profit sector, in particular those who have drawn comparison with the work in the public or profit area. The reason may be the modern communication and motivational manager strategies, encouraging creative, credible and free work environment. The objective of this text is to provide a survey study from the non-profit sector in the Czech Republic and to answer these questions: What are the communication and motivational strategies that can make employee satisfaction in the NGO increase? What non-financial tools are used? What communication errors can managers make?

In addition, considering the eco-friendly and cost effective properties of both ferric ion and polyacrylic acid, there would be great potential for this KCl-Fe3+/PAA hydrogel electrolyte to be broadly applied. Meanwhile, the hydrogel electrolyte maintained good mechanical performance (extensibility > 700%, and stress > 400 kPa) and excellent conductivity (0.09 S cm-1), which completely satisfy the demands of flexible supercapacitors.

"Spirals of Sustainable Academic Motivation, Creativity, and Trust of Higher Education Staff","Sustainability has to penetrate more and more into higher education. It should not focus only on traditional elements. It should also enter new, but for future improvement, extremely important areas. Based on this premise, creativity and motivation, when additionally interconnected and supported by trust that is provided and achieved, decide on the progress and sustainability of universities. This connection is gaining importance especially from the point of view of building solid foundations and mechanisms that functionally preserve the potential effects of these elements in the future. For this reason and following the nature, importance, and content of sustainable academic motivation (SAM), the paper introduces two new concepts: sustainable academic creativity (SAC) and sustainable academic trust (SAT). For further original contributions, the paper hypothesizes the existence of mutual—spiral—relations of sustainable academic motivation (SAM), sustainable academic creativity (SAC), and sustainable academic trust (SAT). The empirical section tests the validity of this claim in the universities of two countries: the Slovak Republic and Poland. A survey performed on a sample of n = 181 pedagogical, scientific, management, and administrative staff in higher education confirms the existence of these spirals. The results indicate the spiral effect of motivation when connected with creativity and trust and show that it is accented by the crucial principles of sustainability (responsibility, novelty, usefulness, progress, etc.). Therefore, the paper’s conclusion contains the explanations for the potential occurrence of three types of sustainably mutual systems and complexes. These are: (a) individual sustainable systems of SAM, SAC, and SAT, (b) group/sectional sustainable systems of SAM, SAC, and SAT, and (c) the global sustainable complex of SAM, SAC, and SAT in the university.",50301.0,"Blašková, Martina",Sustainability,5,high,high,1,1,medium,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Proposal of A2A information system for safety improvement in aerodrome traffic zones of non–towered airports,"The air traffic at non-towered airports has grown considerably in recent years. This increase in air traffic puts greater demands on both: the pilots and the dispatchers of the flight information service.

There are eighty-six non-towered airports in the Czech Republic at present. None of them operates a radar information based air traffic surveillance system. This paper describes a new system that increases safety in the Aerodrome Traffic Zone (ATZ) of non-towered airports.

Hydrophobic Metal-Organic Frameworks,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have diverse potential applications in catalysis, gas storage, separation, and drug delivery because of their nanoscale periodicity, permanent porosity, channel functionalization, and structural diversity. Despite these promising properties, the inherent structural features of even some of the best-performing MOFs make them moisture-sensitive and unstable in aqueous media, limiting their practical usefulness. This problem could be overcome by developing stable hydrophobic MOFs whose chemical composition is tuned to ensure that their metal-ligand bonds persist even in the presence of moisture and water. However, the design and fabrication of such hydrophobic MOFs pose a significant challenge. Reported syntheses of hydrophobic MOFs are critically summarized, highlighting issues relating to their design, characterization, and practical use. First, wetting of hydrophobic materials is introduced and the four main strategies for synthesizing hydrophobic MOFs are discussed. Afterward, critical challenges in quantifying the wettability of these hydrophobic porous surfaces and solutions to these challenges are discussed. Finally, the reported uses of hydrophobic MOFs in practical applications such as hydrocarbon storage/separation and their use in separating oil spills from water are summarized.

Performance of Mobile Networks with UAVs: Can Flying Base Stations Substitute Ultra-Dense Small Cells?,"A crucial challenge for future mobile networks is to enable wide range of scenarios and use cases for different devices spanning from simple sensors to advanced machines or users’ devices. Such requirements call for highly flexible and scalable radio access network (RAN). To provide high flexibility and scalability in dynamic scenarios, flying base stations (FlyBSs), i.e., base stations mounted on general unmanned aerial vehicles, can be integrated into RAN. In this paper, implementation and operational issues related to the FlyBSs are discussed. Additionally scenarios where the FlyBS can be profitable are outlined. Furthermore, we define the architecture of a flying RAN (FlyRAN) encompassing the FlyBSs and enabling real-time control of whole RAN so that it can dynamically adapt to users’ movement and changes in their communication activity. Our results show the superior efficiency of FlyBSs comparing to an ultra-dense deployment of static base stations (BSs) for a realistic scenario with moving users. Our simulations suggest that one FlyBS can provide throughput comparable to static BSs deployed with density corresponding to inter-site distance of 45 meters. At the same time, energy efficiency of the communication for the user equipment can be improved more than 5-times. This indicates that integration of the FlyBSs into mobile networks can be an efficient alternative to ultra-dense small cell deployment, especially in scenarios with users moving in crowds.",20201.0,"Bečvář, Zdeněk:Vondra, Michal:Mach, Pavel:Plachý, Jan:Gesbert, D.",European Wireless 2017,5,high,high,0,1,medium,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Simulation of wheel-rail contact conditions on experimental equipment,"The paper is focused on equipment used in experimental research in the field of rail vehicles.

The main aim of this study is to present an analysis of contact conditions of such bodies with the purpose to reduce (or at least identify) the differences from the conditions of actual railway operation. Firstly, an overview of properties of experimental equipment is given, together with theoretical basis of the most important differences with the use of Hertzian contact for comparison.

As frequently argued, parallelism contributes towards smoother generalization of results to non- laboratory settings and across populations. This paper aims to tackle selected methodological issues related to validity of experiments and evaluate common conjectures about the sharp dichotomy between experimental data and data from the field. Attention is primarily devoted to the use of monetary incentives within experiment, which is believed to control incentives, but which might under certain circumstances affect substantially external validity of an experiment. Specifically, delineation of experiment in terms of choice architecture might trigger certain behavioral features. As a result, monetary incentives may crowd out intrinsic motivation of experimental subjects.",50201.0,"Chytilová, Helena",Canadian International Journal of Social Science and Education,5,medium,medium,1,0,high,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When Informal Institutions Change Institutional Reforms and Informal Practices in the Former Soviet Union,"Book examines how, when, and under what conditions democratic institutional reforms affect informal institutions in hybrid regimes (that is, countries transitioning to democracy). Book analyzes the impact of institutional changes on the use of informal practices and what happens when democratic reforms succeed. Does informality disappear, or do elites and populations continue relying on informal structures? When Informal Institutions Change engages with a growing body of political science, economic, and sociological literature on informal practices and institutions. Book proposes expanding the analysis of the impact of institutional reforms on informal institutions beyond disciplinary boundaries, combining theoretical insights from comparative politics with economic and social theories on informal relations. In addition, Aliyev offers insights relevant to democratization, institutionalism, and human geography. Detailed case studies of three transitional post-Soviet regimes—Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine—illustrate the contentious relationship between democratic institutional reforms and informality in the broader post-Soviet context. Book shows that for institutional reform to strengthen, democratize, and formalize institutions, informal practices and institutions must be approached as instrumental. These findings have implications not only for hybrid regimes but also for other post-Soviet or post-communist countries.",,"Aliyev, Huseyn",,5,medium,high,0,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Colloidal stability of phytosynthesised gold nanoparticles and their catalytic effects for nerve agent degradation,"Herein, Tilia sp. bract leachate was used as the reducing agent for Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) phytosynthesis. The colloidal properties of the prepared Au NPs were determined to confirm their stability over time, and the NPs were then used as active catalysts in soman nerve agent degradation. The Au NPs characterisation, reproducibility and stability studies were performed under transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet visible spectroscopy and with ζ-potential measurements. The reaction kinetics was detected by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detector and solid-phase micro-extraction to confirm the Au NPs applicability in soman hydrolysis. The ‘green’ phytosynthetic formation of colloidal crystalline Au NPs with dominant quasi-spherical shape and 55 ± 10 nm diameter was successfully achieved, and there were no significant differences in morphology, ζ-potential or absorbance values observed during the 5-week period. This verified the prepared colloids’ long-term stability. The soman nerve agent was degraded to non-toxic substances within 24 h, with 0.2156 h−1 reaction rate constant.

Unity and Diversity of medieval (Central) Europe: Social order and its cohesive and disruptive forces.,"Social order and the structure of medieval society has been a topic of research ever since the early studies in medieval history. A new modern approach has been, however, only slow to appear in historical books and articles. Similar to 'new' political history the recent approach does not disregard the power structures and relations in the society, but strives to include all other elements that form the human society in the Middle Ages. Thus, the approaches of the conference will be related to the analysis and comparison of cohesive forces that hold society together and, on the contrary, of disruptive powers and elements that have the potential of bringing changes to medieval society and its order. The analyses of such influences may focus on local or general level, they may concentrate on various components of the life of the society providing insights into the social order and its function. As a conference within the framework of Medieval Central Europe Research Network it will focus on medieval Europe in general, but most importantly on the region of medieval Central and East-Central Europe. Two approaches are desirable: 1) by concentrating on this region an analysis of the development of the above-mentioned elements could be elucidating the crucial tendencies in society, 2) by focusing on a wider geographical, social or temporal frame a comparison might also explain the changes, shifts and transformations in the society as well as its parts and sections. A general question 'How does medieval society work?' might be then transformed into 'How (and why, when, under what circumstances, how often) does medieval society (and its components) change?' And, even more importantly, 'What brings the changes of the society? How is the structure of society reflected in written or material sources?', and finally, 'What holds society together and what destructs the social cohesion?'",,"Kalous, Antonín:Antonín Malaníková, Michaela:Antonín, Robert",,5,medium,high,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
A COMPARISON OF METHODS FOR CALCULATING NOTCH TIP STRAINS AND STRESSES UNDER MULTIAXIAL LOADING,". Selected methods for calculating notch tip strains and stresses in elastic–plastic isotropic bodies subjected to multiaxial monotonic loading were compared. The methods use sets of equations where hypothetical notch tip elastic strains and stresses obtained from FEM calculationsserve as an input. The comparison was performed within two separate groups of methods: the first group consists of the methods intended for cases of multiaxial proportional loading and the second group deals with multiaxial on proportional loading. Originally, the precision of the methods was validated by comparison with results obtained from elastic–plastic FEM analyses. Since computer performance at the time was lower than nowadays, verification of the proposed methods on FEM models with a finer mesh was needed. Such verification was carried out and is presented in this paper. The effect of various formulations of material stress–strain curve was also evaluated.",,"Lutovinov, Maxim:Černý, Jiří:Papuga, Jan",,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Czech style of brewing – keeping tradition,"Poster on the world scientific conference ""Malting and Brewing Symposium ‘12th Trends in Brewing'"" A number of chemical and sensorial markers of Czech beer differ from those of other lager or Pils-type beers. The majority of Czech beers contain a higher residual fermentable extract. According to our long-term monitoring, the average value of difference in attenuation is 4.5 %. Another important characteristic typical for Czech beer is bitterness, which is mostly higher in comparison with other lagers, with the average value at 29 EBC units. Also colour, pH and total polyphenol content are higher in Czech beer. The average values obtained by long-term monitoring were 11.8 EBC, 4.52, and 153 mg/l, respectively. The statistical evaluation of chemical profiles of tested beers (cluster analysis, discrimination analysis, etc., readily separated the brands into two groups, Czech lagers from the others.

The logic of categorisation in sport,"The aim of this paper is to examine the basis of eligibility rules in sport by exhibiting the logic of categorisation, with its associated ethical problems. We shall be concerned mainly with pre-competition categories - age, sex, weight and dis/ability - because they are directly relevant to sports performance and are relatively stable inequalities. We shall prefer to use the term &quot,categorisation&quot,, although we mean by it just what others might mean by classification, to refer to divisions, classes, groups, etc. The paper argues that we have categories only because we consider it desirable to offer some groups protected status in order to enable and promote inclusion and fairness. This desirability condition determines eligibility. Only then do issues arise of which sub-categories we should have, and how they are to be policed. There will always be categories in sport, as a minimum to protect athletes based on age groupings, from children to veterans. But since every categorisation brings its own problems, we need to ensure that we keep them balanced, so that sport can strive for maximum inclusion of different kinds of athletes, and maximum fairness. This requires us to step back from the many particular debates in order to rethink the logic of the whole categorisation process.",30306.0,"Parry, Silvan James:Parry Martínková, Irena",European Journal of Sport Science,5,low,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An 'Entirely-Specific' Situation or a Routine Limitation of the National Autonomy?

Initial echocardiography showed impaired left ventricular (LV) function (ejection fraction 37%) without electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction. Inotropic support was started, intravenous immunoglobulins 2 g/kg, corticosteroids and preventive dose of nadroparin were administered. Echocardiography 42 h later showed normalization of the LV function and multiple thrombi in the LV apex. Heparin was started and the patient was transferred to our institution. At least four large mobile thrombi were detected (Panels A and B). Surgical extraction was considered high risk, therefore, Alteplase was administered in the cathlab after bilateral carotid filter insertion.

New Design Procedure of Transtibial Prosthesis Bed Stump Using Topological Optimization Method,"This paper presents a new design procedure for production of a transtibial prosthesis bed stump by three-dimensional (3D) printing with topological optimization. The suggested procedure combines the medical perspective with finite element analysis and facilitates regaining the symmetry in patients with transtibial prosthesis, which leads to life improvement. The particular focus of the study is the weight reduction of the lower part of the bed stump, while taking into account its stiffness and load-bearing capacity. The first part of the work deals with the analysis of the subject geometry of the bed stump, which is usually oversized in terms of the weight and stiffness that are necessary for the current application. In the second part, an analysis of walking biomechanics with a focus on the impact and rebound phases is presented. Based on the obtained information, a spatial model of the lower part of the bed stump is proposed in the third phase, in which the finite element method is described. In the fourth part, the topological optimization method is used for reducing the structure weight. In the last part, the results of the designed model are analyzed.

Biologically Active Compounds from Hops and Prospects for Their Use,"Although female cones of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus) are known primarily as raw material supplying characteristic bitterness and aroma to beer, their equally significant health-promoting effects have been known to mankind for several thousand years and hop is a plant traditionally utilized in folk medicine. This paper summarizes the scientific knowledge on the effects of all 3 major groups of secondary metabolites of hops, polyphenols, essential oils, and resins. Because of their chemical diversity, it is no coincidence that these compounds exhibit a wide range of pharmacologically important properties. In addition to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer-related properties, particular attention is being paid to prenylflavonoids that occur almost exclusively in hops and are considered to be some of the most active phytoestrogens known. Hop oils and resins are well known for their sedative and other neuropharmacological properties, but in addition, these compounds exhibit antibacterial and antifungal effects. Recently, alpha bitter acids have been shown to block the development of a number of complex lifestyle diseases that are referred to by the collective name ""metabolic syndrome.""

By tracing screenshot’s origins to photographic techniques used for capturing medical imaging, oscillograms, and first applications of computer-aided design, I show a lineage of a straightforward mode of representation built on the assumptions of indexicality and iconic resemblance. However, this initially mechanical act of image reproduction has given rise to transformative practices of promotional and artistic screenshots (represented in this article by in-game photography), which subvert the conventions of accurate representation.

Private subject in wastewater treatment regional coalition project: the case of chemical industry factory,"This paper presents a case study covering the solution to treatment of municipal wastewateroriginating from small villages located close to each other in a protected landscape area. A high environmental efficiency of treatment is required. Two scenarios of the technical solution are compared. In the first scenario, separate wastewater treatment plants will be built and operated in each of the villages. In the second one, sewerage networks will be built in each village and wastewater will be collected and treated in a wastewater treatment plant of a chemical factory located down the stream, the factory is planning to reconstruct and modernise its wastewater treatment plant. Analyses have shown that the second scenario is environmentally beneficial – ensuring high water quality in watercourses in the protected area, using purified water for industrial purposes primarily, and replenish the water balance and flows in dry periods. The second scenario also appears to be beneficial from a socio-economic point of view. Cost savings, appearing mostly at the side of the factory, creates space for negotiation and an agreement between these entities.

Dextromethorphan as a probe drug for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 phenotyping,"Dextromethorphan is metabolized mainly by enzyme 2D6 and in lesser extent also enzyme 3A4 of cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a pivotal role in Phase I biotransformations of xenobiotics. Many of them are known to be polymorphic in genotype and phenotype. as a consequence of huge number of possible allele combinations, a widerange of metabolic activity can be observed among patients in clinical practice. Individual CYP450 metabolic activity may also be affected by numerous exogenous factros which may influence efficacy and safety pharmacotherapy. Therefore, some prediction of metabolic activity is worthwhile in clinical practice. This chapter summarizes the use of dextromethorphan as a marker substrate for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 metabolic activity determination. Ratio of concentration of specific substrate to metabolite(s) in various biological matrices (saliva, plasma/serum, urine) is most widely used methodological approach to assess metabolic activity in vivo. There were also published several approaches using metabolic ratios (ratio of molar concentrations of marker substance to the metabolite,( MR) or ratio of area under concentration curve (AUC) of parent compound to AUC of metabolite to discriminate between extensive and poor metabolizers. Besides determinations of the concentrations of probe and metabolite in biological fluids, specific substrates are used in various breath tests and rarely some other approaches are used, e.g. the pupillometry after opioid administration. Together with the review, authors are presenting their own results in this field. Serum MRDEM/DOR (3 h) correlated well with MRDEM/DOR in urine (0-8 h). Serum MRDEM/DOR discriminated between extensive and poor metabolizers and between extensive + intermediate and poor metabolizers.

The model receives the data from the first and second level of control of the caster via an interface program, evaluates the measured data and carries out a calculation of the temperature field and other aggregated quantities that are sent back to the information system of the steelworks/plant. It aims to enhance the quality and accuracy of the input data, the mutual connections between them and the qualitative parameters, including the establishing of their limit values. This creates a system that not only quickly but also very accurately displays the temperature field of the blank during the course of the actual process, including all necessary technological data from the caster. The dynamic model was integrated into the casting control system. This suggests its usefulness for real deployment, the application and robustness of the used numerical methods and other software parts.",20501.0,"Štětina, Josef:Kavička, František:Katolický, Jaroslav:Mauder, Tomáš:Klimeš, Lubomír",Hutnické listy,5,medium,high,0,0,medium,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

These were the knee or hip joints TEP. The Redon drains were inserted in a standardised method in conventional topical conditions. The samples were processed in the IFCOR 99 Molecular Genetics Laboratory. Using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method were carried out for each collected sample (irrigation solution as well as a part of the drain). Conclusion: It has been confirmed that draining a surgical wound is a standard and safe method which is clearly beneficial to the patient by minimising local risks to the wound healing.

The possibilities to identify combusted fuel based on an analysis of ash from local heating,"Combustion of undesirable components with a high calorific value (waste: plastics, rubber, chipboard, plywood etc.) contribute to an increased emissions of PM particles. The possibility of identification of non-desirable fuels was verified by analysis of unburned carbon from bottom ash by means of pyrolysis-GC/MS. Compounds derived from thermal conversion of main wood components in the unburned carbon are formed by aldehydes, ketones, alkanes, alkenes, alkanoates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compounds containing benzene, compounds containing phenol and nitrogen. Unburned carbon from plywood/chipboard contains compounds with nitrogen (heterocyclic and aliphatic) in increased concentrations (33-51 ng/mg) compared with unburned carbon from pure wood (7-12 ng/mg). The concentrations increased almost two times were proved for compounds containing phenols in unburned carbon from wood composite. Total amount of determined organic compounds is also almost two times higher than that contained in unburned carbon from wood. The indication of waste wood combustion from unburned carbon is possible using the ratio: phenol/(2-methylphenol+4-methylphenol).",20402.0,"Růžičková, Jana:Raclavská, Helena:Kucbel, Marek:Raclavský, Konstantin:Švédová, Barbora:Juchelková, Dagmar",Journal of Environmental Management,5,medium,medium,1,0,medium,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is a healthy microbiome responsible for lower mortality in COVID-19?,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of an ongoing pandemic with significant case fatality ratio (CFR) worldwide. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes respiratory infection by binding to ACE2 receptors present on alveolar epithelial cells, studies have been published linking the disease to the small intestine enterocytes and its microbiome. Dysbiosis of microbiome, mainly intestinal and lung, can affect the course of the disease. Environmental factors, such as reduced intake of commensal bacteria from the environment or their products in the diet, play an important role in microbiome formation, which can significantly affect the immune response. In elderly, obese or chronically ill people, the microbiota is often damaged. Therefore, we speculate that a good microbiome may be one of the factors responsible for lower CFR from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An approach using tailored nutrition and supplements known to improve the intestinal microbiota and its immune function might help minimize the impact of the disease at least on people at higher risk from coronavirus.

Heat transfer in a conﬁned impinging jet with swirling velocity component,Abstract. Heat transfer measurements based on an infrared experimental method (TOIRT) are compared with CFD simulations of a conﬁned impinging jet with tangential velocity component. The tangential velocity component added to a pure impinging jet introduces into the ﬂow ﬁeld and heat transfer some similarities with real industrial processes like agitated vessels with axial-ﬂow impellers. The tangential velocity component signiﬁ cantly inﬂuences the velocity ﬁeld and heat transfer intensity in the stagnant region when compared to the classic impinging jet characteristics. Several turbulence models were used in numerical simulations of an agitated vessel with axial-ﬂow impeller in a draft tube. Heat transfer coeﬃcients at the vessel bottom were evaluated using the TOIRT method and compared with numerical results. The lateral heat conduction in the impinged wall was analysed with the conclusion that it has relatively small impact on the measured heat transfer coeﬃcients. Quite good agreement of experimental data and simulation results was achieved concerning the size and position of the heat transfer maximum at the vessel bottom.,,"Petera, Karel:Dostál, Martin",,5,medium,medium,1,1,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Evaluation of Aberration-corrected Optical Sectioning for Exploring the Core Structure of 1/2[111] Screw Dislocations in BCC Metals,"The introduction of spherical-aberration correctors in the Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopen(STEM) has allowed an improvement in spatial resolution to the sub-angström scale accompanied by anreduction of the depth of focus (due to the increase in probe convergence angles), which in a modernninstrument is just a few nanometers, thus often less than the sample thickness. This can be exploited tonextract information along the beam direction by focusing the electron probe at specific depths within thensample. In this communication we will evaluate the optical sectioning technique to explore the core structure ofn1/2[111] screw dislocations in body-centred cubic (BCC) metals. The study of this structure is of highninterest because the low-temperature plastic deformation of BCC metals is controlled by the glide ofn1/2[111] screw dislocations.

Interfacial interaction between CMS layer and substrate: Critical factors affecting membrane microstructure and H-2 and CO2 separation performance from CH4.,"The claim that quality of membrane fabrication is based on surface smoothness of substrate has been known since the 1960s. In this study, we propose a concept based on the interfacial interaction between the carbon molecular sieving (CMS) selective layer and the Al2O3 substrate to understand the development of the CMS membrane's micro-structure at the molecular level, especially for natural gas purification. We further compare the results with those of our previous work to determine the dominant influence on the structural development of CMS membranes, and discover a remarkable enhancement in H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 gas pair separation performances that surpass the upper limit for polymer membranes proposed by Robeson. Permselectivity performance was found to be strongly related to substrate properties, and especially to the surface roughness. When TiO2 intermediately layer and polishing technology was used to modify the roughness of the substrate, the supported CMS membrane displayed an improvement of 364% and 144% (or 720.1 ± 16.0 and 86.3 ± 5.1) in H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 selectivities, respectively, when compared to bare alumina-supported membranes prepared under the same conditions, the H2 permeability also increased from 537.5 to 566.1 Barrer. These results indicated an important connection between the substrate structure and the performance of the CMS membranes, providing a new understanding of the influence of each preparation parameter and a route to tailoring the structure of CMS membranes that benefit gas separation applications.",20402.0,"Wey, M.-Y.:Wang, Ch.-T.:Lin, Y.-T.:Lin, M.-D.:Uchytil, Petr:Setničková, Kateřina:Tseng, H.-H.",Journal of Membrane Science,5,high,high,0,1,medium,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
